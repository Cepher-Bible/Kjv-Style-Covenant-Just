\v 1 The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helchias, the son of Sadamias, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob,

\v 2 The son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abisei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar,

\v 3 The son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians.

\v 4 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,

\v 5 Go thy way, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me; that they may tell their children's children:

\v 6 Because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have offered unto strange gods.

\v 7 Am not I even he that brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage? but they have provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels.

\v 8 Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people.

\v 9 How long shall I forbear them, unto whom I have done so much good?

\v 10 Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with his servants and all his power have I smitten down.

\v 11 All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyrus and Sidon, and have slain all their enemies.

\v 12 Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord,

\v 13 I led you through the sea and in the beginning gave you a large and safe passage; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest.

\v 14 I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have ye forgotten me, saith the Lord.

\v 15 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token to you; I gave you tents for your safeguard: nevertheless ye murmured there,

\v 16 And triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur.

\v 17 Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me,

\v 18 Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.

\v 19 Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; so ye did eat angels' bread.

\v 20 When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees.

\v 21 I divided among you a fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord.

\v 22 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, When ye were in the wilderness, in the river of the Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my name,

\v 23 I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet.

\v 24 What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and unto those will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes.

\v 25 Seeing ye have forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when ye desire me to be gracious unto you, I shall have no mercy upon you.

\v 26 Whensoever ye shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for ye have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter.

\v 27 Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord.

\v 28 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes,

\v 29 That ye would be my people, and I should be your God; that ye would be my children, and I should be your father?

\v 30 I gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: but now, what shall I do unto you? I will cast you out from my face.

\v 31 When ye offer unto me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feastdays, your new moons, and your circumcisions, have I forsaken.

\v 32 I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord.

\v 33 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind doth stubble.

\v 34 And your children shall not be fruitful; for they have despised my commandment, and done the thing that is an evil before me.

\v 35 Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; which not having heard of me yet shall believe me; to whom I have shewed no signs, yet they shall do that I have commanded them.

\v 36 They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their sins to remembrance, and acknowledge them.

\v 37 I take to witness the grace of the people to come, whose little ones rejoice in gladness: and though they have not seen me with bodily eyes, yet in spirit-breath they believe the thing that I say.

\v 38 And now, brother, behold what glory; and see the people that come from the east:

\v 39 Unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas,

\v 40 Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also an angel of the Lord.

\c 2

\p

\v 1 Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels.

\v 2 The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken.

\v 3 I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before him.

\v 4 But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord.

\v 5 As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant,

\v 6 That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them.

\v 7 Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant.

\v 8 Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha;

\v 9 Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord.

\v 10 Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel.

\v 11 Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.

\v 12 They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary.

\v 13 Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch.

\v 14 Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord.

\v 15 Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.

\v 16 And those that be dead I will raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name in Israel.

\v 17 Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.

\v 18 For thy help I will send my servants Esay and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits,

\v 19 And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy.

\v 20 Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked,

\v 21 Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight of my clearness.

\v 22 Keep the old and young within thy walls.

\v 23 Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection.

\v 24 Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come.

\v 25 Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.

\v 26 As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number.

\v 27 Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance.

\v 28 The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord.

\v 29 My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell.

\v 30 Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord.

\v 31 Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty.

\v 32 Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail.

\v 33 I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord.

\v 34 And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world.

\v 35 Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore.

\v 36 Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly.

\v 37 O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom.

\v 38 Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord;

\v 39 Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord.

\v 40 Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord.

\v 41 The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.

\v 42 I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.

\v 43 And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.

\v 44 So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these?

\v 45 He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.

\v 46 Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands?

\v 47 So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.

\v 48 Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen.

\c 3

\p

\v 1 In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart:

\v 2 For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.

\v 3 And my spirit-breath was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said,

\v 4 O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.

\v 5 And then was the spirit-breath, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man's voice was not yet formed.

\v 6 Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear.

\v 7 Upon the second day thou madest the spirit-breath of the firmament, and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.

\v 8 Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six parts hast thou dried up, and kept them, to the intent that of these some being planted of God and tilled might serve thee.

\v 9 For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made.

\v 10 For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, and many and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day.

\v 11 Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in order:

\v 12 And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was to be made.

\v 13 Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass.

\v 14 For the dumb water and without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works.

\v 15 Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;

\v 16 And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both.

\v 17 Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousand hills:

\v 18 But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, the moist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when.

\v 19 Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things:

\v 20 And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen.

\v 21 All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes

\v 22 As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.

\v 23 And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever been reputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour us.

\v 24 But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thy only begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into their hands.

\v 25 If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure?

\c 4

\p

\v 1 And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,

\v 2 And said, Thy heart hath gone too far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?

\v 3 Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee:

\v 4 Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.

\v 5 And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.

\v 6 Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me?

\v 7 And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:

\v 8 Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.

\v 9 Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them.

\v 10 He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know;

\v 11 How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight?

\v 12 Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.

\v 13 He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,

\v 14 And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.

\v 15 The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.

\v 16 The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.

\v 17 The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them.

\v 18 If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?

\v 19 I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.

\v 20 Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?

\v 21 For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens.

\v 22 Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:

\v 23 For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect,

\v 24 And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy.

\v 25 What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.

\v 26 Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,

\v 27 And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities.

\v 28 But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come.

\v 29 If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.

\v 30 For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come?

\v 31 Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.

\v 32 And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill?

\v 33 Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?

\v 34 And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded.

\v 35 Did not the life-breaths of them that were of old ask these things, and they that are yet to come, saying, Lord, how long?

\v 36 But the Highest answered them, saying, When the number of the seed is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.

\v 37 By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.

\v 38 Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.

\v 39 And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.

\v 40 So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.

\v 41 Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of life-breaths are like the womb:

\v 42 For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them.

\v 43 From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.

\v 44 Then answered I and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,

\v 45 Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.

\v 46 What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.

\v 47 And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.

\v 48 So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.

\v 49 After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.

\v 50 Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.

\v 51 Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days?

\v 52 He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.

\c 5

\p

\v 1 Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.

\v 2 But iniquity shall be increased above that which now thou seest, or that thou hast heard long ago.

\v 3 And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted suddenly.

\v 4 But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day:

\v 5 And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled:

\v 6 And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take their flight away together:

\v 7 And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hear the voice thereof.

\v 8 There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:

\v 9 And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,

\v 10 And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth.

\v 11 One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh a man righteous gone through thee? And it shall say, No.

\v 12 At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.

\v 13 To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and fast seven days, thou shalt hear yet greater things.

\v 14 Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.

\v 15 So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.

\v 16 And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thou been? and why is thy countenance so heavy?

\v 17 Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity?

\v 18 Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd that leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel wolves.

\v 19 Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nigh me. And when he had spoken these words unto me, I was sore afraid.

\v 20 And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,

\v 21 And my life-breath returned unto me, and I began to talk with the most High again,

\v 22 And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one only vine:

\v 23 And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:

\v 24 And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all the builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:

\v 25 And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:

\v 26 And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.

\v 27 And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people over unto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, and why hast thou scattered thy only one people among many?

\v 28 And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them under foot.

\v 29 And if thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands.

\v 30 Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me,

\v 31 And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more.

\v 32 And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel's sake: lovest thou that people better than he that made them?

\v 33 And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.

\v 34 And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother's womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?

\v 35 And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the drops that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered,

\v 36 Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know.

\v 37 And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with men?

\v 38 As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me?

\v 39 Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not discover my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people.

\v 40 And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?

\v 41 And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is no swiftness of the first.

\v 42 So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?

\v 43 Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein.

\v 44 And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present at once.

\v 45 And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why doest thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once.

\v 46 And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.

\v 47 Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their times.

\v 48 For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created.

\v 49 And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.

\v 50 And he said unto me, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee.

\v 51 Say unto her, Wherefore are not they whom thou hast now brought forth like unto them that were before, but less of stature?

\v 52 And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.

\v 53 Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you.

\v 54 And so are they that come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strength of youth.

\v 55 Then I said, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.

\c 6

\p

\v 1 And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,

\v 2 And said, Thy heart hath gone too far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?

\v 3 Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee:

\v 4 Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.

\v 5 And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.

\v 6 Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me?

\v 7 And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:

\v 8 Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.

\v 9 Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them.

\v 10 He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know;

\v 11 How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight?

\v 12 Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.

\v 13 He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,

\v 14 And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.

\v 15 The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.

\v 16 The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.

\v 17 The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them.

\v 18 If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?

\v 19 I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.

\v 20 Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?

\v 21 For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens.

\v 22 Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:

\v 23 For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the Torah of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect,

\v 24 And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy.

\v 25 What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.

\v 26 Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,

\v 27 And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the covenant-just in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities.

\v 28 But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come.

\v 29 If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.

\v 30 For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come?

\v 31 Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.

\v 32 And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill?

\v 33 Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?

\v 34 And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded.

\v 35 Did not the life-breaths of them that were of old ask these things, and they that are yet to come, saying, Lord, how long?

\v 36 But the Highest answered them, saying, When the number of the seed is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.

\v 37 By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.

\v 38 Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.

\v 39 And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the covenant-just are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.

\v 40 So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.

\v 41 Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of life-breaths are like the womb:

\v 42 For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them.

\v 43 From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.

\v 44 Then answered I and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,

\v 45 Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.

\v 46 What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.

\v 47 And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.

\v 48 So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.

\v 49 After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.

\v 50 Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.

\v 51 Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days?

\v 52 He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.

\c 7

\p

\v 1 And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore:

\v 2 And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee.

\v 3 And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great.

\v 4 But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river;

\v 5 Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad?

\v 6 There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all good things:

\v 7 The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water:

\v 8 And one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, so small that there could but one man go there at once.

\v 9 If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall he receive this inheritance?

\v 10 And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel's portion.

\v 11 Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.

\v 12 Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils, and very painful.

\v 13 For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit.

\v 14 If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them.

\v 15 Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal?

\v 16 Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing which is to come, rather than that which is present?

\v 17 Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy Torah, that the covenant-just should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.

\v 18 Nevertheless the covenant-just shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.

\v 19 And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest.

\v 20 For there be many that perish in this life, because they despise the Torah of God that is set before them.

\v 21 For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.

\v 22 Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things;

\v 23 And deceived themselves by their unrighteous deeds; and said of the most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:

\v 24 But his Torah have they despised, and denied his covenants; in his statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed his works.

\v 25 And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.

\v 26 Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth.

\v 27 And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders.

\v 28 For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years.

\v 29 After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life.

\v 30 And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain.

\v 31 And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt

\v 32 And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver those life-breaths that were committed unto them.

\v 33 And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end:

\v 34 But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:

\v 35 And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule.

\v 36 Then said I, Abraham prayed first for Sodom, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:

\v 37 And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan:

\v 38 And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the sanctuary:

\v 39 And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live:

\v 40 And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many.

\v 41 Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the covenant-just have prayed for the ungodly, wherefore shall it not be so now also?

\v 42 He answered me, and said, This present life is not the end where much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak.

\v 43 But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past,

\v 44 Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.

\v 45 Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that hath gotten the victory.

\v 46 I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given him, to have restrained him from sinning.

\v 47 For what profit is it for men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment?

\v 48 O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.

\v 49 For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death?

\v 50 And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are made vain?

\v 51 And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly?

\v 52 And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways of all?

\v 53 And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since we shall not enter into it?

\v 54 (For we have walked in unpleasant places.)

\v 55 And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness?

\v 56 For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for it after death.

\v 57 Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;

\v 58 That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say.

\v 59 For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live.

\v 60 Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have spoken unto them,

\v 61 That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation.

\v 62 I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world,

\v 63 And upon those also that turn to his Torah;

\v 64 And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures;

\v 65 And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth;

\v 66 And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more and more mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come.

\v 67 For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit therein.

\v 68 And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men should not remain living.

\v 69 And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the multitude of contentions,

\v 70 There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude.

\c 8

\p

\v 1 And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.

\v 2 I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even so is the course of this present world.

\v 3 There be many created, but few shall be saved.

\v 4 So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my life-breath, understanding, and devour wisdom.

\v 5 For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live.

\v 6 O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?

\v 7 For thou art alone, and we all one workmanship of thine hands, like as thou hast said.

\v 8 For when the body is fashioned now in the mother's womb, and thou givest it members, thy creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creature which is created in her.

\v 9 But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved: and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth again that which grew in it.

\v 10 For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of the breasts,

\v 11 That the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to thy mercy.

\v 12 Thou broughtest it up with thy covenant-justice, and nurturedst it with thy statutes, and reformedst it with thy judgment.

\v 13 And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it as thy work.

\v 14 If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so great labour was fashioned, it is an easy thing to be ordained by thy commandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved.

\v 15 Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general, thou knowest best; but touching thy people, for whose sake I am sorry;

\v 16 And for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled;

\v 17 Therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land.

\v 18 But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come.

\v 19 Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shall speak before thee. This is the beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up: and I said,

\v 20 O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness which beholdest from above things in the heaven and in the air;

\v 21 Whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand with trembling,

\v 22 Whose service is conversant in wind and fire; whose word is true, and sayings constant; whose commandment is strong, and ordinance fearful;

\v 23 Whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh the mountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth:

\v 24 O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to the petition of thy creature.

\v 25 For while I live I will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer.

\v 26 O look not upon the sins of thy people; but on them which serve thee in truth.

\v 27 Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but the desire of those that keep thy testimonies in afflictions.

\v 28 Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.

\v 29 Let it not be thy will to destroy them which have lived like beasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy Torah.

\v 30 Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love them that always put their trust in thy covenant-justice and glory.

\v 31 For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: but because of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful.

\v 32 For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shalt be called merciful, to us namely, that have no works of covenant-justice.

\v 33 For the covenant-just, which have laid up treasures of good works in the number of their days, shall for their works receive reward.

\v 34 But thou shalt deliver us in thy wonderful mercy, and shalt glorify thy name in us.

\v 35 For the world to come shall bring everlasting rest to the covenant-just, but punishment to the ungodly.

\v 36 For the unrighteous shall go into torment, but the covenant-just shall enter into life.

\v 37 For no work of man shall be accepted after death, neither repentance, nor prayer, nor alms.

\v 38 But according to the works done in the body, shall be the reward.

\v 39 Therefore, O Lord, I will speak of thy mercy, and will praise thee for ever.

\v 40 For thou hast not forsaken thy creatures, but hast visited them in divers times.

\v 41 Thou hast spared the earth when it was ready to perish, and hast renewed the world when it was corrupted.

\v 42 Thou hast not destroyed the wicked, but hast taught them thy ways.

\v 43 Thou hast not left the ungodly without chastisement, but hast brought them to repentance.

\v 44 Thou hast not taken away the hearts of the covenant-just, but hast increased their faith.

\v 45 Therefore thy mercy is magnified in the covenant-just, and thy judgment in the ungodly.

\v 46 Blessed art thou, O Lord, for evermore.

\v 47 Then the angel said unto me, Thou hast spoken rightly in all these things.

\v 48 But yet there is more behind.

\v 49 For the most High hath not made one world, but two.

\v 50 For whereas thou hast said that the covenant-just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound: hear the answer thereunto.

\v 51 If thou have but a few precious stones, wilt thou not add unto them lead and clay?

\v 52 I said, Lord, how can that be?

\v 53 And he said unto me, Not only this, but ask the earth, and she shall tell thee; entreat her, and she shall declare unto thee.

\v 54 For thou shalt say unto her, Thou bringest forth gold and silver and brass, and iron also and lead and clay:

\v 55 But silver is more than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, lead than iron, and clay than lead.

\v 56 Judge thou therefore which things are precious and to be desired, what is abundant or what is rare.

\v 57 I said, O Lord that bearest rule, the things that be rare are more precious than those that be plentiful.

\v 58 And he answered me, saying, Weigh within thyself the things that thou hast thought: for he that hath what is hard to get, rejoiceth more than he that hath what is plentiful.

\v 59 So also is the promise of the judgment which I have promised: for I will rejoice over the few that shall be saved, because these are they that have made my glory to prevail now, and through them is my name made known.

\v 60 And I will not grieve over the multitude of them that perish; for these are they that are now like unto vapour, and are become as flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are quenched.

\v 61 And I answered and said, O earth, wherefore hast thou brought forth, if the mind is made out of dust, like as all other creatures?

\v 62 For it had been better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made thereof.

\v 63 But now the mind groweth with us, and therefore we are tormented, because we perish, and know it.

\v 64 Let the race of men lament, and the beasts of the field be glad: let all that are born mourn, but let the cattle and beasts rejoice.

\v 65 For it is better with them than with us; for they look not for judgment, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised unto them after death.

\v 66 For what profiteth it unto us, that we shall be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment?

\v 67 For all that are born are defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with offences:

\v 68 And if after death we were not to come into judgment, peradventure it had been better for us.

\v 69 He answered me, and said, When the most High made the world, and Adam, and all them that came of him, he first prepared the judgment, and the things that pertain unto the judgment.

\v 70 And now understand from thine own words, for thou hast said that the mind groweth with us.

\v 71 They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for this cause, that having understanding they have wrought wickedness, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having the Torah have transgressed it.

\v 72 And what shall they have to say in the judgment, or how shall they answer in the last times?

\v 73 For how long time hath the most High been patient with them that inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he hath foreordained!

\v 74 Then answered I and said, If I have found grace before thee, shew me this also, whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.

\v 75 What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.

\v 76 And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.

\v 77 So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.

\v 78 After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.

\v 79 Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.

\v 80 Then I prayed, and said, Shall I live till then? or what shall happen in those days?

\v 81 He answered me, and said, If thou ask concerning these things, I will tell thee in part; but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; neither do I know.

\c 9

\p

\v 1 He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,

\v 2 Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.

\v 3 Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:

\v 4 Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning.

\v 5 For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:

\v 6 Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonders and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.

\v 7 And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,

\v 8 Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.

\v 9 Then shall the wicked be left behind, and shall be mocked of the creatures, and shall be delivered to torment.

\v 10 And they that have cast away my commandments, and have been disobedient unto me, shall be ashamed.

\v 11 Therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.

\v 12 For they also received freedom, but despised the most High, thought scorn of his Torah, and forsook his ways.

\v 13 Moreover they have trodden down his covenant-just, and have done despite unto his holy things.

\v 14 Therefore saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon them, and they shall be in pain and anguish.

\v 15 And they shall say in that day, O Lord, why hast thou given us over unto these?

\v 16 And they shall be tormented with everlasting pain.

\v 17 But the covenant-just shall be preserved, and shall rejoice in my salvation.

\v 18 And they shall see the glory of the most High, and shall be filled with joy.

\v 19 And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name.

\v 20 And they shall return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds.

\v 21 For they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.

\v 22 And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.

\v 23 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them.

\v 24 O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?

\v 25 And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.

\v 26 This is the interpretation of the vision: The man whom thou sawest come up from the heart of the sea,

\v 27 Is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.

\v 28 And all they that are left of thy people, which are found within my borders, shall he rule with mercy.

\v 29 And it shall be in the last days, that he shall set up his kingdom in the world.

\v 30 And he shall rebuke the ungodly for their ungodliness, and shall reprove them for their unrighteousness.

\v 31 And he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto fire.

\v 32 And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;

\v 33 Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.

\v 34 But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,

\v 35 That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.

\v 36 And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow passages of the river.

\v 37 For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.

\v 38 For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.

\v 39 Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,

\v 40 The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace.

\v 41 But they that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.

\v 42 Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.

\v 43 And then shall he shew them great wonders.

\v 44 Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?

\v 45 And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the time of his day.

\v 46 This is the interpretation of the vision which thou sawest.

\v 47 And whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the heart of the sea: the same is he whom God the Highest keepeth for many times, which by his own self shall deliver his creature.

\v 48 And shall order them that are left.

\v 49 And whereas thou sawest that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;

\v 50 And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but destroyed the multitude that came to fight against him: this is the interpretation:

\v 51 Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.

\v 52 And he shall come unto the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.

\v 53 One shall think to subdue another, and one city another city, and one people another people, and one realm another realm.

\v 54 And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.

\v 55 And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.

\v 56 And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.

\v 57 But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.

\v 58 And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.

\v 59 And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;

\v 60 And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto fire.

\v 61 And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;

\v 62 Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.

\v 80 Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.

\v 81 And he shall come unto the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.

\v 82 And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.

\v 83 And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.

\v 84 And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.

\v 85 And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.

\v 86 But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.

\v 90 And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;

\v 91 Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.

\p

\v 1 And I looked, and, behold, the man that came up from the heart of the sea, he flew with the clouds of heaven: and wheresoever he turned his countenance to look, all things trembled that were seen under him.

\v 2 And wheresoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire.

\v 3 After this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea

\v 4 But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.

\v 5 But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.

\v 6 And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight.

\v 7 And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war:

\v 8 But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.

\v 9 And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid.

\v 10 Afterward I beheld the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable multitude.

\v 11 And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said,

\v 12 Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer:

\v 13 Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.

\v 14 For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are not left behind!

\v 15 For they that were not left were in heaviness.

\v 16 Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind.

\v 17 Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.

\v 18 Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said,

\v 19 The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.

\v 20 Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:

\v 21 He that shall sustain the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.

\v 22 Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.

\v 23 This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea:

\v 24 The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.

\v 25 And whereas thou sawest that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;

\v 26 And that he held neither sword nor weapon of war, but destroyed the multitude that came to make war against him: this is the interpretation:

\v 27 Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.

\v 28 And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.

\v 29 And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.

\v 30 And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.

\v 31 And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.

\v 32 And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.

\v 33 But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.

\v 34 And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.

\v 35 And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;

\v 36 And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto fire.
