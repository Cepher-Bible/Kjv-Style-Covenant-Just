\c 1

\p

\v 1 Love covenant-justice, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart seek him.

\v 2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.

\v 3 For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.

\v 4 For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.

\v 5 For the holy spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.

\v 6 For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.

\v 7 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: insomuch as he that holdeth all things together knoweth what is said.

\v 8 Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.

\v 9 For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.

\v 10 For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.

\v 11 Beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that it shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.

\v 12 Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not destruction upon you with the works of your hands.

\v 13 For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.

\v 14 For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:

\v 15 For covenant-justice is immortal:

\v 16 But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it.

\c 2

\p

\v 1 For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Short and tedious is our life; and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither hath there been any man known to return from the grave.

\v 2 Because by chance we were born, and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and while our heart beateth reason is a spark,

\v 3 Which being extinguished, the body shall be turned into ashes, and the spirit-breath shall vanish as the soft air,

\v 4 And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the traces of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.

\v 5 For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is sealed, so that no man cometh again.

\v 6 Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that now are, and use the creature freshly as in youth.

\v 7 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:

\v 8 Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:

\v 9 Let none of us be left behind in our riotous mirth: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.

\v 10 Let us oppress the poor covenant-just man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.

\v 11 Let our strength be the law of covenant-justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.

\v 12 Therefore let us lie in wait for the covenant-just; because he is not for our turn, he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and layeth to our charge the sins against our way of life.

\v 13 He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.

\v 14 He was made to reprove our thoughts.

\v 15 He is grievous unto us to behold: for his life is unlike other men's, and his ways are very strange.

\v 16 We are esteemed of him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he preferreth the latter end of the covenant-just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.

\v 17 Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of his life.

\v 18 For if the covenant-just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.

\v 19 Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.

\v 20 Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.

\v 21 Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.

\v 22 As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of covenant-justice, nor discerned the reward of pure souls.

\v 23 For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.

\v 24 Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do experience it.

\c 3

\p

\v 1 But the souls of the covenant-just are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.

\v 2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,

\v 3 And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.

\v 4 For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality:

\v 5 And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.

\v 6 As gold in the furnace hath he tried them and received them as a burnt offering.

\v 7 And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.

\v 8 They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.

\v 9 They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and visitation for his elect.

\v 10 But the ungodly shall have a punishment according to their own thoughts, since they neglected the covenant-just, and forsook the Lord.

\v 11 For whoso despiseth wisdom and instruction, he is unhappy: and the hope of such is vain, and their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:

\v 12 Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:

\v 13 Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore barren is the chaste woman that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: her fruit shall be in the visitation of souls.

\v 14 And blessed is the eunuch, which hath not wrought iniquity, nor imagined evil against the Lord: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.

\v 15 For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.

\v 16 As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.

\v 17 For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.

\v 18 Or if they die quickly, they have no hope, nor comfort in the day of trial.

\v 19 For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.

\c 4

\p

\v 1 Better it is to be childless with covenant-justice; for the memorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, and with men.

\v 2 When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards and stedfast.

\v 3 But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor stand any time in the rock of the ice.

\v 4 For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and by the force of winds they shall be rooted out.

\v 5 The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing.

\v 6 For the children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.

\v 7 But the covenant-just man, though he die early, will be at rest.

\v 8 For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years.

\v 9 But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age.

\v 10 He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated.

\v 11 Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.

\v 12 For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of desire perverteth the simple mind.

\v 13 He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time:

\v 14 For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked.

\v 15 This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace was great among his saints, and his mercy among his chosen.

\v 16 Thus the covenant-just that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected condemneth the many years of the unrighteous old man.

\v 17 For when he dieth, he shall have no hope: he shall not be comforted in the day of trial.

\v 18 For he shall be led at the last with his fear unto the torment of the wicked.

\v 19 For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, and shall shake them from the foundations; they shall be left speechless, and they shall be shaken from the foundation.

\v 20 They shall go through the fearful valley, and the wind shall carry them away: and their iniquity shall be brought to remembrance.

\c 5

\p

\v 1 Then shall the covenant-just man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.

\v 2 When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for.

\v 3 And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:

\v 4 We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:

\v 5 How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!

\v 6 Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of covenant-justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of covenant-justice rose not upon us.

\v 7 We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.

\v 8 What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?

\v 9 All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by;

\v 10 And as a ship that passeth over the waves: whereof when it is gone by, the trace cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves;

\v 11 Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, which no man can see: but they see the air where it is, and yet know not where it came from, nor whither it went: so is the way of them which are past by the way of unrighteousness.

\v 12 For the hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like the smoke which goeth forth and is scattered abroad by the wind; like the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.

\v 13 But the covenant-just live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.

\v 14 Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord's hand: for with his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.

\v 15 He shall take to him his jealousy for armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.

\v 16 He shall put on covenant-justice as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of an helmet.

\v 17 He shall take holiness for an invincible shield, and sharpen his severe wrath for a spear, and the world shall fight with him against the unwise.

\v 18 Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; the clouds fly to and fro in his indignation, and hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow.

\v 19 The water shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them.

\v 20 A mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.

\c 6

\p

\v 1 Wisdom is better than strength: yet the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

\v 2 The king's speech is in his mouth: but the poor man's wisdom is not regarded.

\v 3 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

\v 4 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.

\v 5 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

\v 6 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\v 7 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

\v 8 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.

\c 7

\p

\v 1 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.

\v 2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.

\v 3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

\v 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

\v 5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

\v 6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.

\v 7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.

\v 8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

\v 9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

\v 10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

\v 11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.

\v 12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

\v 13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?

\v 14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

\v 15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

\v 16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

\v 17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

\v 18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.

\v 19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.

\v 20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

\v 21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:

\v 22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

\v 23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.

\v 24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

\v 25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

\v 26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

\v 27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:

\v 28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

\v 29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.

\c 8

\p

\v 1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.

\v 2 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.

\v 3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

\v 4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

\v 5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

\v 6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.

\v 7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?

\v 8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

\v 9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.

\v 10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.

\v 11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

\v 12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:

\v 13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.

\v 14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.

\v 15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

\v 16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

\v 17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

\c 9

\p

\v 1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.

\v 2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

\v 3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

\v 4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

\v 5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.

\v 6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

\v 7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

\v 8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

\v 9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

\v 10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

\v 11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

\v 12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

\v 13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:

\v 14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:

\v 15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.

\v 16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

\v 17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

\v 18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.

\c 10

\p

\v 1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.

\v 2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.

\v 3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

\v 4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

\v 5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:

\v 6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

\v 7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

\v 8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

\v 9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

\v 10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

\v 11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.

\v 12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

\v 13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

\v 14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

\v 15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

\v 16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

\v 17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

\v 18 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

\v 19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.

\v 20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

\c 11

\p

\v 1 Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.

\v 2 For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.

\v 3 For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.

\v 4 And being but one she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.

\v 5 For God loveth none but such as dwell with wisdom.

\v 6 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.

\v 7 For after this cometh night: but wisdom shall not be overcome of wickedness.

\c 12

\p

\v 1 For thy incorruptible Spirit is in all things:

\v 2 Wherefore thou dost chasten them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have sinned, that leaving their wickedness they may believe in thee, O Lord.

\v 3 For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.

\v 4 For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times when thou wilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm?

\v 5 For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of the balance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth.

\v 6 But thou hast mercy upon all: for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should repent.

\v 7 For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made: for never wouldst thou have made any thing, if thou hadst hated it.

\v 8 But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of souls.

\v 9 For thy incorruptible Spirit is in all things:

\v 10 Wherefore thou dost chasten them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have sinned, that leaving their wickedness they may believe in thee, O Lord.

\v 11 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 12 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\v 13 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 14 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\v 15 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 16 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\v 17 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 18 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\v 19 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 20 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\v 21 For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, though they were destroyed with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might change from their wickedness:

\v 22 With what care and tenderness hast thou judged thy sons, unto whose fathers thou gavest covenants of good promises?

\c 13

\p

\v 1 Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things which are seen know him that is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster;

\v 2 But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, to be the gods which govern the world.

\v 3 With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first author of beauty hath created them.

\v 4 But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let them understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.

\v 5 For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionally the maker of them is seen.

\v 6 But yet these men are less to be blamed: for they do err perhaps seeking God, and desiring to find him.

\v 7 For being conversant in his works they search carefully, and believe their sight: because the things that are seen are beautiful.

\v 8 Howbeit neither are they to be excused.

\v 9 For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?

\v 10 But miserable are they, and their hope is among the dead, who call them gods, which are the works of men's hands, gold and silver, the invention of art, and the image of beasts, or a stone good for nothing, the work of an ancient hand.

\v 11 Now if any man maketh it, it is for the use of man: and he that made it, he made it for his own use.

\v 12 But the workman that made them is not with them, neither are they gods.

\v 13 But they are dead, and their hope is among the dead: for they are fools.

\v 14 And the most foolish of all are they that worship idols, which are dead gods.

\v 15 For either gold or silver, or any other metal, they take and fashion it, and make it according to the form of a man, or of some beast, or of some bird.

\v 16 And they make it to be their god, and fall down and worship it.

\v 17 Then they set it in a wall, and fasten it with iron and nails, lest it should fall.

\v 18 They provide for it that it may not fall, knowing that it cannot help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.

\v 19 Yet they call upon it as though it could do something, and pray unto it concerning their goods, and their wives, and their children, and their cattle.

\v 20 And they are not ashamed to call upon that which is dead, as though it were alive.

\v 21 And they desire that it should be their god, and they are not ashamed to worship it.

\v 22 Their heart is ashes, their eyes are blinded, their understanding is darkened.

\v 23 They know not the secrets of God, nor hope for the wages of righteousness, nor esteem the reward of pure souls.

\v 24 For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.

\v 25 Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do experience it.

\v 1 Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.

\v 2 For verily desire of gain devised it, and the workman built it by his skill.

\v 3 But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;

\v 4 Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.

\v 5 Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle: therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the waves in a frail vessel are saved.

\v 6 For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.

\v 7 For blessed is the wood wherewith the righteous is made.

\v 8 But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was named god.

\v 9 For both the ungodly and his ungodliness are alike hateful unto God.

\v 10 For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.

\v 11 Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creation of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.

\v 12 For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.

\v 13 For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.

\v 14 For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.

\v 15 For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.

\v 16 Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images worshipped by the commandments of kings.

\v 17 Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.

\v 18 For this cause, the artificer, willing to do the king a pleasure, hath made the resemblance more skilful.

\v 19 And the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured as a man.

\v 20 And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stocks the name which none ought to be given but unto God alone.

\v 21 Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred about the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.

\v 22 For whilst they slew their children, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;

\v 23 They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.

\v 24 So that there reigned in all men without natural affection, blood, murder, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, false oaths.

\v 25 For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, cause, and end, of all evil.

\v 26 For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live ungodly, or lightly forswear themselves.

\v 27 For insomuch as their children are of no estimation with them, while they use them for the worship of devils, they give them the name of gods: and they are not ashamed to be like unto them.

\v 28 And because they thought it not fit to give them the honour due unto God, they gave them the name of gods.

\v 29 Now the end of these things is to be destroyed.

\v 30 For it is an evil thing to worship idols, and to be deceived in the knowledge of God.

\v 31 For the name of God is blasphemed through them: for they are the cause of the destruction of many.

\v 1 But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,

\v 2 For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but if we sin not, we know that we are counted thine.

\v 3 For to know thee is perfect covenant-justice: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.

\v 4 For neither did the evil giving of men's invention, nor the deceitful art of painters, nor the multitude of the names of the heathen, bring into the world the image of idols.

\v 5 But the miserable life of the heathen was the cause of this.

\v 6 For they worshipped the works of their own hands, and the senseless images, and the beasts.

\v 7 For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also such as serve for the contrary uses, but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.

\v 8 And employing his labour about them, he fashioneth with great diligence every one for his use.

\v 9 And he maketh a god of the same clay, and maketh it with much labour, and he maketh it a vain god, and setteth it up in his house.

\v 10 His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:

\v 11 Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit-breath.

\v 12 But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be gaining every way, though it be by evil means.

\v 13 For this man, than he that maketh a thing, knoweth more of it than any man.

\v 14 But the most foolish are they that worship idols, which are dead gods.

\v 15 For they are the cause of the destruction of many.

\v 16 For the name of God is blasphemed through them: for they are the cause of the destruction of many.

\v 17 For they are dead, and their hope is among the dead: for they are fools.

\v 18 For either gold or silver, or any other metal, they take and fashion it, and make it according to the form of a man, or of some beast, or of some bird.

\v 19 And they make it to be their god, and fall down and worship it.

\v 20 Then they set it in a wall, and fasten it with iron and nails, lest it should fall.

\v 21 They provide for it that it may not fall, knowing that it cannot help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.

\v 22 Yet they call upon it as though it could do something, and pray unto it concerning their goods, and their wives, and their children, and their cattle.

\v 23 And they are not ashamed to call upon that which is dead, as though it were alive.

\v 24 And they desire that it should be their god, and they are not ashamed to worship it.

\v 25 Their heart is ashes, their eyes are blinded, their understanding is darkened.

\v 26 They know not the secrets of God, nor hope for the wages of covenant-justice, nor esteem the reward of pure souls.

\v 1 For these things were done unto them after a fashion, that they might be punished by the very things wherein they sinned.

\v 2 For their foolish and wicked thoughts, which deceived them, they hid themselves in the secret places of the earth, and were found out.

\v 3 For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with strange apparitions.

\v 4 For neither did the den where they lay keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.

\v 5 No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.

\v 6 But there appeared unto them a fearful sight of fire, and they feared the things which they saw, and trembled at the sight of the visions.

\v 7 No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.

\v 8 But there appeared unto them a fearful sight of fire, and they feared the things which they saw, and trembled at the sight of the visions.
