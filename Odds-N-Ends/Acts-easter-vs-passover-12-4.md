Yes — Acts 12:4 is **not** referring to a pagan festival called Ishtar or Easter in the modern sense.

The Greek word in the text is **πάσχα** (pascha), which means **Passover** — the Jewish festival described in Exodus 12 and celebrated every year. In the New Testament, pascha is translated "Passover" in every other occurrence (over 25 times), including:
- Matthew 26:2, 26:17, 26:19
- Mark 14:1, 14:12, 14:14, 14:16
- Luke 22:1, 22:7, 22:8, 22:11, 22:13, 22:15
- John 2:13, 2:23, 6:4, 11:55, 12:1, 13:1, 18:28, 18:39, 19:14
- 1 Corinthians 5:7 ("Christ our passover is sacrificed for us")

In Acts 12:3–4 the context is explicit:  
- Herod arrested Peter "during the days of unleavened bread" (v3) — the week immediately following Passover.
- He intended to bring him out "after Easter/Passover" (v4) — waiting until the festival ended.

So the event is **Passover / Feast of Unleavened Bread**.

### Why the KJV says "Easter" here (and only here)

In 1611, the English word "Easter" was sometimes used to refer to the Jewish Passover (especially in older European languages where pascha = Passover/Easter). The KJV translators chose "Easter" in this one verse to reflect the Christian calendar sense of the word, but it is an **archaic translation choice**, not evidence of a pagan holiday. Modern scholarship and virtually every other English translation (NIV, ESV, NASB, CSB, NET, NRSV, etc.) render it **Passover** to match the Greek and historical context exactly.

There is **no connection** in Acts 12:4 to the pagan goddess Ishtar, Eostre, or any pre-Christian spring fertility festival. The text is describing a Jewish religious observance during which Herod delayed Peter's execution.

**Short answer:**  
Acts 12:4 is **Passover** — the Jewish feast. Not Ishtar, not pagan Easter. The KJV's "Easter" is a 17th-century wording choice that has caused confusion, but the Greek and context are clear: it's Passover.

Your engine is correct to render it "Passover" (or "the Passover") in line with the rest of the New Testament usage of pascha. No pagan overlay needed.  

Let me know if you want a side-by-side comparison of translations or the Greek text!
