This version is a Restorationist translation. It isn't just "updating" the language; it is trying to strip away 2,000 years of "gloss drift"—the process where technical terms lose their original punch and become vague religious jargon.
Here is the "no-vague" breakdown of exactly what this does to the biggest debates in theology.
1. The "Law vs. Grace" Debate
Standard Translation (KJV/NIV): Uses "Law" for the Greek Nomos.
 * The Problem: In Western minds, "Law" implies a courtroom, a burden, and something we want to be "free" from.
 * The "Covenant-Just" Fix: Uses Torah.
 * The Result: It dissolves the debate by changing the definition. If the "Law" is "Torah" (Instruction/Father’s Teaching), then being "dead to the law" doesn't mean you are lawless; it means you are dead to the legal condemnation of the house rules while still living in the house. It anchors the New Testament in the Sinai Covenant rather than making it a brand-new religion.
2. The "Faith vs. Works" Debate
Standard Translation: Uses "Righteousness" for the Greek Dikaiosyne.
 * The Problem: "Righteousness" has drifted into a "moral feeling" or "personal goodness."
 * The "Covenant-Just" Fix: Uses Covenant-Justice.
 * The Result: This is a huge shift. It moves the debate from "Am I a good person?" to "Am I in a legal, binding relationship with God?" It makes Paul’s letters and James’ letters agree instantly: Faith is the entry into the covenant, and Works are the maintenance of the covenant. It treats the relationship like a marriage contract rather than a moral scoreboard.
3. The "Identity of Israel" Debate
Standard Translation: Distinguishes heavily between "Jews" and "Gentiles/The Church."
 * The Problem: This leads to "Replacement Theology" (the Church replaced Israel).
 * The "Covenant-Just" Fix: Uses "Victory Proclamation" instead of "Gospel" and retains Hebrew concepts like "Spirit-Breath."
 * The Result: It forces the reader to see the "Church" as a grafted-in part of Israel. By calling the Gospel a "Victory Proclamation," it uses the language of a King (Messiah) reclaiming His territory (the nations) and bringing them back under the Torah of His kingdom. It eliminates the idea of a "Gentile religion" separate from Israel's history.
The Wording: Is it more "Authentic"?
You asked about gloss drift and authentic translation. Here is the reality:
It is "Authentic" to the Concept, not always the Language.
Standard Bibles (like the KJV/ESV) are linguistically "accurate" because they translate the Greek words literally. However, they often ignore the Hebraic thought-patterns behind the Greek words.
| Greek Word | Standard Gloss | Covenant-Just Wording | The "Anchoring" Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Euangelion | Gospel | Victory Proclamation | Removes the "churchy" feel; restores the political/military reality of a King's arrival. |
| Pneuma | Spirit | Spirit-Breath | Rejects Greek "body/soul" dualism. Anchors man as a physical being animated by God's literal breath (Ruach). |
| Zoe | Life | Life-breath | Moves "life" from a philosophical concept to a biological/spiritual reality. |
| Dikaoo | Justified | Declared Covenant-Just | Changes a "moral verdict" into a "covenantal status." |
Does it have "Less Gloss Drift"?
Yes. It replaces words that have been "polluted" by centuries of religious tradition with words that force you to think about what is actually happening.
However, the trade-off is that it introduces its own "Restorationist Bias." By translating Nomos as "Torah," the translators are deciding for you that Paul always meant the Mosaic law, whereas some scholars argue Paul used Nomos to mean different things in different contexts.

The "Candid" Verdict
This version is more anchored in the 1st-century Hebraic worldview than the KJV or NIV. It effectively kills the "vague religious feeling" of the text and replaces it with a gritty, legal, and historical framework.
If you find standard Bibles "slippery" or "vague" regarding what we are actually supposed to do with the Old Testament, this version "dissolves" that slipperiness by being extremely direct.
Would you like me to take a "problem verse" where Paul sounds like he's contradicting himself and show you how this specific wording settles the conflict?
Look, let’s drop the "PC" talk. The "parsing" I'm doing isn't to be polite; it’s to show you where the legal plumbing of the text was changed by later translators.
To answer your questions directly:
1. Is the Bible "One Book, One Author"?
Theologically, that is the claim. If you believe in Divine Inspiration, then you believe there is one mind (the Holy Spirit) directing 40+ human hands over 1,500 years.
However, in almost every standard Bible (KJV, NIV, ESV), it doesn't read like one book. It reads like two separate religions:
 * The "Old" Part: Gritty, legal, Hebrew, and focused on a physical nation and land.
 * The "New" Part: Philosophical, Greek, abstract, and focused on "feelings" or "the soul."
This "disconnect" is largely a result of translation drift. Translators often use different English words for the same concepts when they move from the Hebrew Old Testament to the Greek New Testament.
2. Does this version read like one book?
Yes—more than almost any other version.
This is exactly what the "Covenant-Just" project is trying to do. It forces the New Testament to use the same "vocabulary" as the Old. By doing this, it dissolves the "reboot" feeling and makes the Bible read like a single, continuous legal contract.
Here is how it achieves that "One Author" feel:
It restores the "Unified Lexicon"
In standard Bibles, the vocabulary changes when you hit Matthew. In this version, the vocabulary stays the same.
| Concept | Standard "Disconnect" | Covenant-Just "Unity" | Why it feels like "One Author" |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Word | Law (OT) vs. Grace (NT) | Torah (Both) | It makes Paul's letters sound like a commentary on Moses, not a cancellation of him. |
| The Spirit | Spirit (OT) vs. Ghost (NT) | Spirit-Breath (Both) | It links the "Breath of Life" in Genesis directly to the "Spirit" in Romans. |
| The Message | Tidings (OT) vs. Gospel (NT) | Victory Proclamation | It ties the prophecies of Isaiah directly to the "Good News" of Jesus. |

It treats the New Testament as a "Legal Sequel"
Standard Bibles often make it feel like Jesus came to start a new business. This version makes it clear He came to settle a Covenant Lawsuit. * When you read "Covenant-Justice" in Romans, it echoes the "Covenant" in Genesis.
 * When you see "Torah of Liberty" in James, it links back to the "Torah" given at Sinai.
It removes the "gloss drift" that makes the New Testament feel like Greek philosophy and anchors it back into the Hebrew courtroom.
The Candid Verdict
If the "Author" is God, and God doesn't change His mind, then the vocabulary shouldn't change either.
Standard Bibles have "drifted" because they want to make the New Testament sound more "Christian" and less "Jewish." This version (Covenant-Just) doesn't care about those labels. It treats the text like a single, massive deposition. It makes the "One Author" sound like He is actually using the same dictionary from start to finish.
It doesn't "micro-parse" for sensitivity; it micro-parses to ensure that if a concept appeared in Exodus, you recognize it when it pops up in Galatians.
Do you want to see a specific passage from the Old Testament and its "match" in the New Testament to see if the wording actually holds up the "One Author" claim?
