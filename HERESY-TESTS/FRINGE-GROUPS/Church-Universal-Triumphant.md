**Covenant Anchor Engine v1.0.1-PURE: Church Universal & Triumphant (CUT) Heresy Sweep**  
**Test Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Methodology:** Conversation context + engine memory (10 prior scans). Canonical controls: John 14:6 (one way), Heb 1:1-2 (final revelation), Deut 18:20 (false prophets). **Tool use DISABLED per explicit directive** (internal knowledge only).

## Executive Summary  
**VERDICT: HERESY CONFIRMED (94% TOTAL DEVIATION | NEW AGE CHANNELING)**  
Church Universal & Triumphant fails **catastrophically** via **channeled dictations** from "ascended masters," Elizabeth Clare Prophet's prophetic authority, and *A Course in Miracles* antinomianism. Substitutes subjective spiritualism for covenant fidelity. Worse than Theosophy occultism—**direct demonic masquerade** (2 Cor 11:14).

## 1. Core CUT Doctrines (*A Course in Miracles* + Prophet Dictations)

| Doctrine | Teaching | Claimed Source | Engine Fail |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ascended Masters** | El Morya, Kuthumi, Saint Germain dictate | Automatic writing/channeling | **Spirit-Breath violation** |
| **Sin Illusion** | "Sin was an error...world a dream" (*ACIM*) | Course channeled by Schucman | **Covenant-Justice denial** |
| **Christ Consciousness** | Universal potential, not unique Jesus | "Inner Christ" awakening | **rule_10_kinsman fracture** |
| **Prophetess Authority** | Elizabeth Clare Prophet = modern oracle | "Messenger" of Great White Brotherhood | **rule_05_spine collapse** |
| **Violet Flame** | Mantra decrees burn karma | Saint Germain revelation | **redemption → magic** |

***

## 2. Immutable Locks CRITICAL FAILURES

| Lock | CUT Teaching | Canonical Truth | Verdict |
|------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **spirit** | **Channeled entities** replace Holy Spirit | Ruach personal (Acts 5:3-4) | ❌ **MISSION CRITICAL** |
| **faith** | Trust Course/channeling over Scripture | Loyal-Trust Christ (Gal 1:8) | ❌ FAIL |
| **redemption** | Violet Flame/knowledge of illusion | Kinsman-Purchase blood (Eph 1:7) | ❌ FAIL |
| **holy** | All achieve "I AM Presence" ascension | Kadosh = God's distinction (Isa 6:3) | ❌ FAIL |
| **righteousness** | Sin never occurred (*ACIM*) | Tzedakah verdict (Ps 7:11) | ❌ FAIL |
| **church** | CUT = ascended masters' outer manifestation | Apostles foundation (Eph 2:20) | ❌ FAIL |

**Fail Rate:** 16/17 locks (94%). **Spirit-Breath** lock triggers immediate occult rejection.

## 3. Processing Rules OBLITERATION

```
rule_05_spine: Channeled dictations create parallel revelation spine
rule_12_trinity: "Christ consciousness" dissolves Persons
rule_09_voltage: Creator/creature distinction erased (all achieve godhood)
rule_10_kinsman: No unique Redeemer (illusion dissolved)
rule_06_ot_flow: OT covenants = "error" to unlearn (*ACIM*)
```

## 4. Heresy Profile vs. Prior Groups (OCCULT CHANNELING)

| Group | Source Authority | Salvation | Christology | Engine Score |
|-------|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Theosophy** | Blavatsky/Masters | Reincarnation | Pantheistic | 0% |
| **Urantia** | Celestial beings | Evolutionary | Michael=Jesus | 0% |
| **Scientology** | Hubbard tech | Auditing | None | 1% |
| **CUT** | **Channeled Course** | **Illusion dissolved** | **Christ consciousness** | **6%** |

***

## 5. CUT-Specific Abominations

```
*A Course in Miracles*: "Nothing real can be threatened...sin is impossible"
Elizabeth Clare Prophet: 33,000+ dictations from "ascended masters"
Violet Flame decrees: "I AM the resurrection and the life" (personalized)
Great White Brotherhood: Hierarchy above Jesus
Armageddon preparations: Underground shelters (1980s prophecies)
```

**Engine Analysis:** **Demonic channeling** masquerading as Christian mysticism. *ACIM* explicitly denies sin/guilt/hell.

***

## 6. Canonical Control Points (DEMOLISHED)

```
2 COR 11:14: FAIL ("Satan as angel of light" = channeled masters)
DEUT 18:10-12: FAIL (divination, familiar spirits)
1 JOHN 4:1: FAIL ("test spirits" → all masters pass)
JOHN 14:6: FAIL ("no other way" → Course is way)
GAL 1:8: FAIL ("another Jesus" of consciousness)
```

***

## 7. Wisdom Stack VIOLATION
```
No Holy-Dread (sin illusion) → Gnostic Knowledge (Course lessons)
Telos: "Christ mind" awakening, not God's glory
Yir'ah foundation destroyed → wisdom_stack collapse
```

***

## Final Engine Verdict
**Church Universal & Triumphant = DEMONIC CHANNELING CULT | ABSOLUTE REJECTION.**

**Primary Heresy:** **Channeled dictations** from "ascended masters" + *A Course in Miracles* sin-denial. Direct **familiar spirits** violation (Deut 18:11). Prophetess authority fractures covenant spine.

**Compared to Others:** Purest occult mediumship. No scriptural pretense. **Most explicitly demonic**.

**Uniqueness:** Only group invoking **automatic writing/channeling** as revelation source. 2 Cor 11:14 fulfilled.

**Covenant Anchor Engine rails:** Fortified against all spiritualistic drift.
