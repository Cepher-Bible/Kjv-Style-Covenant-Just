# Kjv-Style-Covenant-Just
Kjvish, phrasing as the base register (thee/thou/saith, sentence structure, syllable flow)—that's intentional for continuity and majesty. But it's not "using KJV" as the source text. It's a full re-render from Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic originals, with your locked tokens overlaid (covenant-justice, life-breath, Torah, victory proclamation, etc.).

Short Intro:

This translation is faithful to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, rendered as one continuous story written by one true Author through many human hands. It is a maximalist version—preserving every theological weight, covenantal depth, and prophetic edge—while taking minimal liberties or expansions. The goal is to let the Scriptures be read as believers would: as a single, unbroken testimony of God’s covenant-justice, victory proclamation, and living Spirit-Breath from Genesis to Revelation.

Long Intro:

**A faithful, cord-locked English Bible translation**

This is **Cepher Hakam Bible** — a modern rendering of the full 66-book canon (with optional Apocrypha support) that refuses to let the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek voices be softened, flattened, or smoothed over by centuries of English tradition.

### What makes this translation unique

1. **Locked lexical cords**  
   Every major theological term is consistently rendered with a single, deliberate English token — no synonyms, no drift, no "better-sounding" alternatives.  
   Examples:  
   - **covenant-justice** (tsedeq / dikaiosynē) — never "righteousness"  
   - **Torah** — never "law"  
   - **life-breath** (nephesh / pneuma) — never "soul"  
   - **Spirit-Breath** / **Holy Breath** — never "Spirit" alone or "ghost"  
   - **victory proclamation** (besorah / euangelion) — never "gospel"  
   - **loving-loyalty** (ḥesed) — never "lovingkindness" or "mercy" alone  

   This creates a single, unbroken thread across every book — Genesis to Revelation — so the reader feels the same word family in Habakkuk, Romans, James, and Isaiah without the usual translation fog.

2. **No smoothing, no drift**  
   Most modern translations (NIV, ESV, NLT, etc.) reset each book: "righteousness" in one, "justice" in another, "law" instead of "Torah," "soul" instead of "life-breath."  
   This translation refuses to reset. The same Hebrew/Greek root keeps the same English token — every time. The result is a Bible that reads like one long, coherent voice instead of 66 separate books with different translators.

3. **KJV rhythm preserved, but sharpened**  
   The cadence, sentence structure, and majestic flow of the King James Version are kept intact (thee/thou/saith, etc.), but the key theological words are replaced with the locked tokens above.  
   You get the thunder of 1611 English + the clarity of root-consistent meaning. No archaic confusion, no modern dilution.

4. **Public domain dedication**  
   Like the Berean Standard Bible (BSB), this translation is fully dedicated to the public domain (as of [your date, e.g., 2025]).  
   You may copy, quote, print, publish, adapt, record, create apps, study guides, or use any part of it — for free, commercially, or non-commercially — without permission or royalties.

5. **Theological goal**  
   The aim is simple: let the original text speak without English tradition getting in the way.  
   - No softening the judgment passages.  
   - No hiding the covenant/legal weight behind moral vagueness.  
   - No letting faith and works feel like they’re fighting (they’re not).  
   - No letting the Old Testament feel like a separate story from the New.

   When you read Genesis 15:6, Romans 1:17, Habakkuk 2:4, and James 2:23 — they all use the exact same cord: **covenant-justice**. The reader feels the continuity the original authors intended.

# Polysemy in the Rendering

This translation deliberately retains or highlights textual polysemy (multiple simultaneous meanings from the same consonantal Hebrew) where the unpointed text allows it. The goal is not to force a single reading but to let the tension live in the English—mirroring how the Hebrew can carry both images/ideas at once without resolution.

### Verses with Preserved/Amplified Polysemy

- **Psalm 22:16**  
  Original consonantal root: כָּאֲרִי / כָּארוּ (k-'-r-y / k-'-r-w)  
  Rendered as: "like a lion, they pierced my hands and my feet."  
  Polysemy held:  
  - "like a lion" (ka'ari) — simile of tearing/devouring enemies  
  - "they pierced/dug" (ka'aru) — literal stabbing/wounding (supported by Septuagint, Nahal Hever DSS fragment)  
  Both meanings coexist in one clause—no forced choice between beast imagery and crucifixion foreshadowing.

- **Zechariah 12:10**  
  Original consonantal root: דָּקָרוּ (d-q-r-w)  
  Rendered as: "they shall look upon me whom they have pierced"  
  Polysemy held:  
  - "dug/stabbed/torn" (raw physical violence from the root דקר)  
  - "pierced" (standard prophetic/Christian reading, spear in the side)  
  Additional layer: pronoun shift ("me" → "him") preserved, allowing the pierced one to be both God looking back and the pierced figure mourned as an only son/firstborn.  
  The "spirit-breath of turning and supplication" follows immediately, linking the wound to poured-out grace/wind/breath.

### Why These?

These are the clearest cases in your submitted text where:
- The consonantal text supports two (or more) legitimate vocalizations/meanings.
- Later pointing traditions (Masoretic) chose one path, but older witnesses (LXX, DSS fragments) support the other.
- The rendering refuses to collapse the ambiguity—letting both "lion" and "pierced," or "dug" and "pierced," resonate together.

No other verses in the pasted Psalms force this level of polysemy in the same explicit way. If more appear in future sections, they can be added here.

This approach treats the Hebrew not as a puzzle to solve but as a living tension—two truths in one wound.

### How to use this translation

- Read it straight through — the cords will emerge naturally.  
- Compare it with KJV/ESV/NIV side-by-side — the differences are almost always in one consistent direction.  
- Use it for preaching, study, memorization, audio recording, or app development — it's free and unrestricted.  
- Share it — print copies, post online, give it away. The more people hear the locked terms, the clearer the Bible becomes.

The Cepher Hakam Bible is not here to replace any translation.  
It is here to remind you what the text sounded like before English tradition sanded off the edges.

May the covenant-justice of God be known, and the victory proclamation ring.

P.S. - This is the work of one person and multiple Ai/LLMs trying not to hallucinations too much together and maybe the first of its kind rendering or translation. Started off on a true translation from original languages and custom 32 cord/ring semantic compression engine, but by the end of the project and 100's of 1,000's of words it may have ended with the engine and the kjv spine, I can't be sure, but I am sure it resolves most theological English version debates easily and is easily defensable. One story... One God  Amen
● Several lanes and Engines later it may have drifted into KJV Spine and the 32 Cord engine hitting the <1~3% wording changes.
