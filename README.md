# Kjv-Style-Covenant-Just
Kjvish, phrasing as the base register (thee/thou/saith, sentence structure, syllable flow)—that's intentional for continuity and majesty. But it's not "using KJV" as the source text. It's a full re-render from Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic originals, with your locked tokens overlaid (covenant-justice, life-breath, Torah, victory proclamation, etc.).

***the following is goals, not accual achievements***
***after years of only seeing discontinuity I see things differently***

Short Intro:

This translation is faithful to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, rendered as one continuous story written by one true Author through many human hands. It is a maximalist version—preserving every theological weight, covenantal depth, and prophetic edge—while taking minimal liberties or expansions. The goal is to let the Scriptures be read as believers would: as a single, unbroken testimony of God’s covenant-justice, victory proclamation, and living Spirit-Breath from Genesis to Revelation.

Long Intro:

**A faithful, cord-locked English Bible translation**

This is **Cepher Hakam Bible** — a modern rendering of the full 66-book canon (with optional Apocrypha support) that refuses to let the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek voices be softened, flattened, or smoothed over by centuries of English tradition.

### What makes this translation unique

1. **Locked lexical cords**  
   Every major theological term is consistently rendered with a single, deliberate English token — no synonyms, no drift, no "better-sounding" alternatives.  
   Examples:  
   - **covenant-justice** (tsedeq / dikaiosynē) — never "righteousness"  
   - **Torah** — never "law"  
   - **life-breath** (nephesh / pneuma) — never "soul"  
   - **Spirit-Breath** / **Holy Breath** — never "Spirit" alone or "ghost"  
   - **victory proclamation** (besorah / euangelion) — never "gospel"  
   - **loving-loyalty** (ḥesed) — never "lovingkindness" or "mercy" alone  

   This creates a single, unbroken thread across every book — Genesis to Revelation — so the reader feels the same word family in Habakkuk, Romans, James, and Isaiah without the usual translation fog.

2. **No smoothing, no drift**  
   Most modern translations (NIV, ESV, NLT, etc.) reset each book: "righteousness" in one, "justice" in another, "law" instead of "Torah," "soul" instead of "life-breath."  
   This translation refuses to reset. The same Hebrew/Greek root keeps the same English token — every time. The result is a Bible that reads like one long, coherent voice instead of 66 separate books with different translators.

3. **KJV rhythm preserved, but sharpened**  
   The cadence, sentence structure, and majestic flow of the King James Version are kept intact (thee/thou/saith, etc.), but the key theological words are replaced with the locked tokens above.  
   You get the thunder of 1611 English + the clarity of root-consistent meaning. No archaic confusion, no modern dilution.

4. **Public domain dedication**  
   Like the Berean Standard Bible (BSB), this translation is fully dedicated to the public domain (as of [your date, e.g., 2025]).  
   You may copy, quote, print, publish, adapt, record, create apps, study guides, or use any part of it — for free, commercially, or non-commercially — without permission or royalties.

5. **Theological goal**  
   The aim is simple: let the original text speak without English tradition getting in the way.  
   - No softening the judgment passages.  
   - No hiding the covenant/legal weight behind moral vagueness.  
   - No letting faith and works feel like they’re fighting (they’re not).  
   - No letting the Old Testament feel like a separate story from the New.

   When you read Genesis 15:6, Romans 1:17, Habakkuk 2:4, and James 2:23 — they all use the exact same cord: **covenant-justice**. The reader feels the continuity the original authors intended.

### How to use this translation

- Read it straight through — the cords will emerge naturally.  
- Compare it with KJV/ESV/NIV side-by-side — the differences are almost always in one consistent direction.  
- Use it for preaching, study, memorization, audio recording, or app development — it's free and unrestricted.  
- Share it — print copies, post online, give it away. The more people hear the locked terms, the clearer the Bible becomes.

The Cepher Hakam Bible is not here to replace any translation.  
It is here to remind you what the text sounded like before English tradition sanded off the edges.

May the covenant-justice of God be known, and the victory proclamation ring.
