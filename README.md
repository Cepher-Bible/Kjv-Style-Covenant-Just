Cepher Hakam Bible – A Faithful Rendering in Majestic English
This is a personal effort to present the Scriptures (the 66-book canon, with optional Apocrypha) as a single, continuous testimony—from Genesis to Revelation—written by one true Author through many faithful hands.
The translation draws directly from the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek originals, seeking to honor their theological depth, covenantal emphasis, and prophetic sharpness with as few liberties as possible.
Distinctive Elements
Consistent Key Terms ("locked cords"): Major theological words are rendered uniformly to reveal connections across the Bible.
covenant-justice (for tsedeq / dikaiosynē)
Torah (instead of "law")
life-breath (for nephesh / pneuma)
Spirit-Breath / Holy Breath
victory proclamation (for besorah / euangelion)
loving-loyalty (for ḥesed)
This helps the reader sense the unified voice of Scripture, without the shifts common in many English versions.
Preserved Cadence: The rhythmic majesty and structure of the King James Version are maintained (thee/thou/saith, etc.), paired with these consistent terms for clarity and continuity.
Textual Ambiguities Honored: In passages where the original consonantal text allows multiple valid readings (supported by ancient versions like the Septuagint or Dead Sea Scrolls), both layers are allowed to resonate. Examples:
Psalm 22:16 — "like a lion, they pierced my hands and my feet" (holding "lion" imagery and "pierced" wounding together).
Zechariah 12:10 — "they shall look upon me whom they have pierced" (retaining physical violence and prophetic depth, with pronoun tension).
Purpose
The aim is modest: to let the original texts speak more directly, without certain longstanding English conventions softening their edges. It seeks to highlight God's covenant-justice, victory proclamation, and living Spirit-Breath as one coherent story.
