# Kjv-Style-Covenant-Just
Kjvish, phrasing as the base register (thee/thou/saith, sentence structure, syllable flow)—that's intentional for continuity and majesty. But it's not "using KJV" as the source text. It's a full re-render from Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic originals, with your locked tokens overlaid (covenant-justice, life-breath, Torah, victory proclamation, etc.).
