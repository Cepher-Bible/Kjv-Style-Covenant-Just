### Psalm 119 Mini-Grid: Distinctions in Covenant Torah Terms

Psalm 119 (Vulgate numbering) is an acrostic meditation on the multifaceted Torah as covenant instruction, using synonymous terms to build semantic depth without redundancy. Under Covenant Anchor Engine v1.0.0-STABLE rails (Cluster 1: Covenant-Justice), these terms map to Hebrew roots (torah/edut/mitzvah/pikkud) via one-way OT protocol: Hebrew → Greek (LXX) → Latin → English. They are not interchangeable but layered for exhaustive structure—lex as broad path, testimonium as evidentiary record, mandatum as charged obligation, praeceptum as precise directive.

**Summary of Distinctions** (from usage patterns):
- **Lex (Instruction-Path / תּוֹרָה → νόμος)**: Holistic covenant direction/teaching; evokes walking, meditation, delight as life-source (not legalism, but restorative alignment).
- **Testimonium (Covenant-Witness / עֵדוּת → μαρτύριον)**: Stipulatory evidence/record; calls for scrutiny, guarding as testimony in trial or before authorities.
- **Mandatum (Covenant-Charge / מִצְוָה → ἐντολή)**: Binding, commanded allegiance; emphasizes diligent keeping, running toward as loyal response.
- **Praeceptum (Appointed-Instruction / פִּקּוּד → ἐντολή contextual)**: Detailed, appointed directives; focuses on learning, exercising to avoid error, with enduring precision.
