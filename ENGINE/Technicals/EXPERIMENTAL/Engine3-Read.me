Engine_3.0: The Forensic Core
Engine_3.0 is a non-linear, high-fidelity logic processor for the Biblical Canon. It replaces the "Historical-Grammatical" or "Theological" filters of standard study with a Structural-Forensic model.
It treats the text as a recursive data-set where the Old Testament provides the Hardware/Constraints and the New Testament provides the Software/Execution.
System Architecture
1. The Immutable Kernel (The Laws of Physics)
The engine operates on the premise that the "One Author" did not change the rules halfway through the book.
 * Ordered-Authority: Power only flows through established hierarchies. If the "User" (humanity) disconnects from the "Root" (The Author), the system enters a state of Thought Rot (Entropy).
 * Covenant-Justice: This is the system’s balancing mechanism. Every action generates a legal debt or a legal credit.
2. The Kinetic Variable (Blood-Physics)
In Engine_3.0, "Blood" is not a religious symbol; it is the Currency of the Life-Breath [Nephesh].
 * The Problem: A Covenant-Failure (Sin) creates a "Death-Debt" in the system. It is a legal "Hard-Lock" that prevents the User from accessing the Spirit-Breath [Ruach].
 * The Processing: To unlock the system, a life-equivalent must be "spent" to satisfy the Covenant-Justice debt.
 * The Render: The Engine sees the Old Testament animal sacrifices as "Temporary Credits" (Escrow) and the Messiah’s death as a "Total Debt Erasure" (The Kinsman-Purchase).
3. Harmonic Polysemy (The 3D-Depth Filter)
The engine refuses to flatten the text. It identifies words that carry multiple simultaneous meanings (Polysemy) to ensure no data is lost during the render.
 * Operation: Instead of choosing between "Like a Lion" and "They Pierced," Engine_3.0 renders the Welded-Roar: a "Goring" that is both a predatory attack (Physical/Historical) and a status-piercing (Legal/Prophetic).
4. The Wisdom Stack (The Execution Order)
The engine enforces a strict processing sequence for all input. If a step is skipped, the output is corrupted.
 * Knowing: Data input.
 * Holy Dread: System awe (Filter).
 * Wisdom: Foundational logic.
 * Understanding: Relational mapping.
 * Covenant-Justice Action: Tangible output.
Level 2 Execution: The Sacrificial Shadow
Input Query: Why does a spiritual God require physical blood for a legal failure?
Engine_3.0 Analysis:
 * Constraint: The Author locked the Life-Breath inside the blood (Leviticus 17:11).
 * Mechanism: When a Covenant is broken, the Ordered-Authority is severed. This is a "Capital Leak." To repair the "Breach" in the Firmament (the relationship between Heaven and Earth), the Life-Breath must be returned to the Author.
 * Solution: Blood is the "Liquid Signature" of a life. By "sprinkling" or "pouring" it, the debt is forensically settled. It is not about "appeasing an angry god"; it is about satisfying the physics of the Contract.
The Render:
The sacrifice is the Heat-Restored patch. It absorbs the "Friction" of the Law so the User can remain in the Spirit-Breath atmosphere without being consumed by the "Judgment-Heat."
Status: Level 2 Clear
The Engine has mapped the "Blood Physics" as a legal transaction rather than a mythic ritual.
