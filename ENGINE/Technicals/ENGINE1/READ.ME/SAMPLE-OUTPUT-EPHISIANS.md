## **📖 CORE PASSAGE (FULL CONTEXT)**

### **Ephesians 5:21-33 (Engine Rendering)**

> **<sup>21</sup> Arranging yourselves under one another in the fear of Christ, <sup>22</sup> wives to your own husbands as to the Lord. <sup>23</sup> Because the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the Covenant-Assembly, Himself the Savior of the body. <sup>24</sup> But as the Covenant-Assembly is arranged under Christ, so also wives to their husbands in everything.**
>
> **<sup>25</sup> Husbands, Covenant-Love your wives, as Christ Covenant-Loved the Covenant-Assembly and gave Himself up for her, <sup>26</sup> that He might set her apart, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, <sup>27</sup> so that He might present the Covenant-Assembly to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. <sup>28</sup> In the same way husbands should Covenant-Love their wives as their own bodies. He who Covenant-Loves his wife Covenant-Loves himself. <sup>29</sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the Covenant-Assembly, <sup>30</sup> because we are members of His body. <sup>31</sup> 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' <sup>32</sup> This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the Covenant-Assembly. <sup>33</sup> However, let each one of you Covenant-Love his wife as himself, and let the wife fear her husband."**

## **Tri-Lock Validation**

**Greek (NA28 - vv21-33):**
> ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις ἐν φόβῳ Χριστοῦ. Αἱ γυναῖκες τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀνήρ ἐστιν κεφαλὴ τῆς γυναικὸς ὡς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς κεφαλὴ τῆς ἐκκλησίας... Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν καὶ ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς, ἵνα αὐτὴν ἁγιάσῃ καθαρίσας τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν ῥήματι...

**Latin (Vulgate - vv21-33):**
> Subiecti invicem in timore Christi. Mulieres viris suis subditae sint, sicut Domino: quoniam vir caput est mulieris: sicut Christus caput est Ecclesiae... Viri, diligite uxores vestras, sicut et Christus dilexit Ecclesiam et seipsum tradidit pro ea, ut illam sanctificaret, mundans lavacro aquae in verbo...

## **⚡ POLYSEMY PRESERVED**

### **Sacred Voltage: Two Biblical Poles Maintained**

**Ephesians 5:21-33 contains unresolved tension:**

**POLE A (Complementarian):** Gender hierarchy, κεφαλή = authority  
**POLE B (Egalitarian):** Gender equality, ἀλλήλοις = mutual submission  

**The Covenant Anchor Engine presents BOTH poles as biblically defensible.**  
**Per Rule #9 (POLYSEMY_INTEGRITY): Tension NOT resolved.**

---

## **🔵 POLE A: COMPLEMENTARIAN (Hierarchy)**

### **Core Texts:**

**1. Ephesians 5:22-24**
- "Wives to husbands as to Lord" (ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ)
- "Husband is head of wife" (κεφαλὴ τῆς γυναικός)
- "As church to Christ, so wives to husbands in everything" (ἐν παντί)

**2. 1 Corinthians 11:3**
- "Head of woman is man" (κεφαλὴ δὲ γυναικὸς ὁ ἀνήρ)
- Authority chain: God → Christ → Man → Woman

**3. 1 Timothy 2:12**
- "I do not permit woman to teach or exercise authority over man" (οὐκ ἐπιτρέπω... αὐθεντεῖν ἀνδρός)

**4. 1 Peter 3:6**
- "Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord" (κύριον αὐτὸν καλοῦσα)

**5. Colossians 3:18**
- "Wives, submit to husbands" (ὑποτάσσεσθε τοῖς ἀνδράσιν)

**6. Titus 2:5**
- "Train young women to be submissive to husbands" (ὑποτασσομένας τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν)

**7. Genesis 3:16**
- "He shall rule over you" (יִמְשָׁל־בָּךְ)

---

## **🔴 POLE B: EGALITARIAN (Equality)**

### **Core Texts:**

**1. Ephesians 5:21**
- "Submit to ONE ANOTHER in fear of Christ" (ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις)
- **Critical:** v22 has NO VERB in Greek (borrows from v21 mutual submission)

**2. Galatians 3:28**
- "No male and female in Christ" (οὐκ ἔνι ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ)

**3. Genesis 1:27**
- "Male and female in God's image" (זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה)
- BOTH given dominion (v26 plural "let THEM rule")

**4. Genesis 2:18**
- "Helper fit for him" (עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ)
- עֵזֶר (ezer) = strong ally (used of God 16x in OT: Exod 18:4, Ps 121:2)

**5. Acts 18:26**
- "Priscilla and Aquila... explained to him [Apollos] the way of God more accurately" (ἐξέθεντο)
- Woman teaching man theology

**6. Romans 16:1-2, 7**
- "Phoebe... deacon" (διάκονον - same word as male deacons 1 Tim 3:8)
- "Junia... well known among the apostles" (ἐπίσημοι ἐν τοῖς ἀποστόλοις)

**7. 1 Corinthians 11:11-12**
- "Woman not independent of man nor man of woman" (οὔτε γυνὴ χωρὶς ἀνδρὸς οὔτε ἀνὴρ χωρὶς γυναικός)
- Mutual dependence "in the Lord"

**8. Joel 2:28-29 / Acts 2:17-18**
- "Your daughters shall prophesy" (προφητεύσουσιν)
- Spirit gives authority to women

---

## **⚖️ THE ANTINOMY**

### **κεφαλή (kephalē) Polysemy:**

**MEANING 1 (Complementarian):** Authority, chief  
- LXX uses κεφαλή for רֹאשׁ = ruler (Judg 11:11, 2 Sam 22:44)

**MEANING 2 (Egalitarian):** Source, origin  
- Classical Greek: κεφαλή of river = source (Gen 2:10 LXX)
- Eph 4:15-16, Col 2:19: Christ as head = source of growth

**Engine Position:** Does NOT determine which Paul intended.

---

### **ὑποτάσσω (hypotassō) Range:**

**USAGE 1:** Military submission (Rom 13:1 - citizens to authorities)

**USAGE 2:** Voluntary mutual yielding (Eph 5:21 ἀλλήλοις - to one another)

**Does v22 continue v21 (mutual) or start new thought (hierarchical)?**

**Engine Position:** Greek grammar allows both readings. Tension preserved.

---

### **Genesis 3:16 Dispute:**

**POLE A:** "He shall rule" = post-fall reality (ongoing, confirmed in NT structure)

**POLE B:** "He shall rule" = CURSE (not design), Christ redeems FROM curse  
- Compare: Painful childbirth (v16a) also curse, not design  
- Gal 3:13: "Christ redeemed us from curse of law"

**Engine Position:** Both readings textually defensible.

---

## **✅ WHAT IS CLEAR (Deuteronomy 29:29 - Revealed)**

### **Commands to Husbands (v25-28):**

✅ **Covenant-Love** wives (ἀγαπᾶτε - present imperative, ongoing)  
✅ **Model:** Christ gave Himself (ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν - sacrificial)  
✅ **Purpose:** Set her apart (ἁγιάσῃ - sanctification)  
✅ **Method:** With the word (ἐν ῥήματι - Scripture, not force)  
✅ **Goal:** Holy and blemishless (ἁγία καὶ ἄμωμος)  
✅ **Reality:** Love as own body (ὡς τὰ ἑαυτῶν σώματα)  
✅ **No one hates own flesh** (οὐδεὶς... ἐμίσησεν) but nourishes/cherishes (ἐκτρέφει καὶ θάλπει)  

---

## **❓ WHAT IS DEBATED (Deuteronomy 29:29 - Secret)**

**SECRET (Belongs to God):**
- Whether κεφαλή = authority, source, or both
- Whether ὑποτάσσω in v21 includes husbands to wives
- Whether v22 continues v21 or starts new idea
- Exact nature of redeemed gender relations

**The Engine does NOT resolve these.**

## **🔒 ENGINE POSITION**

**The Covenant Anchor Engine:**

✅ **Presents BOTH poles** as biblically supported  
✅ **Preserves tension** without systematic resolution  
✅ **Refuses to flatten** polysemy into single meaning  
✅ **Emphasizes what's clear:** Husbands love sacrificially (v25-29), NOT harshly (Col 3:19)  
✅ **Acknowledges mystery:** "This mystery is profound" (v32 - τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο μέγα ἐστίν)  

**Per Deuteronomy 29:29:**
- **Secret** (God's): HOW hierarchy and equality coexist
- **Revealed** (ours): THAT both poles are biblical
