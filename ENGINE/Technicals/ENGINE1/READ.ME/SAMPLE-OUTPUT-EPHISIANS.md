## **📖 CORE PASSAGE**

### **Ephesians 5:21-33 (Engine Rendering)**

> **<sup>21</sup> Arranging yourselves under one another in the fear of Christ, <sup>22</sup> wives to your own husbands as to the Lord. <sup>23</sup> Because the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the Covenant-Assembly, Himself the Savior of the body. <sup>24</sup> But as the Covenant-Assembly is arranged under Christ, so also wives to their husbands in everything.**
>
> **<sup>25</sup> Husbands, Covenant-Love your wives, as Christ Covenant-Loved the Covenant-Assembly and gave Himself up for her, <sup>26</sup> that He might set her apart, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, <sup>27</sup> so that He might present the Covenant-Assembly to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. <sup>28</sup> In the same way husbands should Covenant-Love their wives as their own bodies. He who Covenant-Loves his wife Covenant-Loves himself. <sup>29</sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the Covenant-Assembly, <sup>30</sup> because we are members of His body. <sup>31</sup> 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' <sup>32</sup> This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the Covenant-Assembly. <sup>33</sup> However, let each one of you Covenant-Love his wife as himself, and let the wife fear her husband.**

## **Tri-Lock Validation**

**Greek (NA28):**
> ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις ἐν φόβῳ Χριστοῦ... Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν καὶ ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς...

**Latin (Vulgate):**
> Subiecti invicem in timore Christi... Viri, diligite uxores vestras, sicut et Christus dilexit Ecclesiam et seipsum tradidit pro ea...

**Key Terms:**
- ὑποτασσόμενοι (hypotassomenoi) = arranging under
- ἀλλήλοις (allēlois) = one another
- κεφαλή (kephalē) = head
- ἀγαπᾶτε (agapate) = Covenant-Love

# **SCENARIO 1: HUSBAND IN SIN**

## **Wife's Response**

### **Primary Text: 1 Peter 3:1-6**

> **"Likewise, wives, be arranged under to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful and pure conduct."**

**Greek:**
> Ὁμοίως [αἱ] γυναῖκες ὑποτασσόμεναι τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν, ἵνα καὶ εἴ τινες ἀπειθοῦσιν τῷ λόγῳ διὰ τῆς τῶν γυναικῶν ἀναστροφῆς ἄνευ λόγου κερδηθήσονται

**Key Terms:**
- **ἀπειθοῦσιν (apeithous in)** = disobey (present tense - ongoing)
- **ἄνευ λόγου (aneu logou)** = **without a word**
- **κερδηθήσονται (kerdēthēsontai)** = will be won (future passive - God's work)
- **ἀναστροφή (anastrophē)** = conduct, behavior

---

### **What Scripture Commands:**

✅ **Continue submitting** (ὑποτασσόμεναι - present participle)  
✅ **Silent witness** (ἄνευ λόγου - without word)  
✅ **Pure conduct** (ἁγνή ἀναστροφή)  
✅ **Gentle, quiet spirit** (πραΰς καὶ ἡσύχιος v4)  
✅ **Trust God to win him** (κερδηθήσονται - passive, God acts)  

### **What Scripture Does NOT Say:**

❌ Leave him  
❌ Stop submitting  
❌ Nag him to repentance  
❌ Refuse marital intimacy (1 Cor 7:3-5)  
❌ Publicly expose sin  

---

### **Supporting Text: 1 Corinthians 7:13-16**

> **"If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is set apart through his wife."**

**Greek:**
> καὶ γυνὴ εἴ τις ἔχει ἄνδρα ἄπιστον, καὶ οὗτος συνευδοκεῖ οἰκεῖν μετ' αὐτῆς, μὴ ἀφιέτω τὸν ἄνδρα· ἡγίασται γὰρ ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἄπιστος ἐν τῇ γυναικί

**Key Terms:**
- **ἄπιστος (apistos)** = unbeliever
- **μὴ ἀφιέτω (mē aphietō)** = do not divorce (present imperative negative)
- **ἡγίασται (hēgiastai)** = has been set apart (perfect passive)
- **ἐν τῇ γυναικί (en tē gynaiki)** = through the wife

**Principle:**
- Stay with unbelieving/sinful husband
- Your presence sanctifies (sets apart)
- Hope to save him (v16)
- Exception: If HE abandons, you are "not enslaved" (v15)

---

### **Can Wife Confront Husband's Sin?**

**Matthew 18:15 - Possible Application:**

> **"If your brother sins, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone."**

**Greek:**
> Ἐὰν δὲ ἁμαρτήσῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ὕπαγε ἔλεγξον αὐτὸν μεταξὺ σοῦ καὶ αὐτοῦ μόνου

**Key:**
- **ἐλέγχω (elegchō)** = reprove, show fault
- **μεταξὺ μόνου (metaxy monou)** = privately, alone

**Conditions:**
1. **IF** husband sins against her specifically
2. **Private** confrontation
3. **Gentle** spirit (Gal 6:1 - πραΰτης)
4. Goal: **GAIN** him (same verb as 1 Pet 3:1)

**Cautions:**
- 1 Peter 3:1 prioritizes **silent witness** as primary
- Proverbs 21:9 warns against quarreling wife
- If you confront: RARELY, GENTLY, after MUCH prayer

---

### **Summary: Wife When Husband in Sin**

**PRIMARY METHOD:**
✅ Silent witness (ἄνευ λόγου)  
✅ Pure conduct (ἁγνή ἀναστροφή)

# **SCENARIO 2: WIFE IN SIN**

## **Husband's Response**

### **Primary Text: Ephesians 5:25-27**

> **"Husbands, Covenant-Love your wives, as Christ Covenant-Loved the Covenant-Assembly and gave Himself up for her, that He might set her apart, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word."**

**Greek:**
> Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν καὶ ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς, ἵνα αὐτὴν ἁγιάσῃ καθαρίσας τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν ῥήματι

**Key Terms:**
- **ἀγαπᾶτε (agapate)** = Covenant-Love (present imperative - ongoing)
- **παρέδωκεν (paredōken)** = gave up (sacrificial)
- **ἁγιάσῃ (hagiasē)** = set apart, sanctify
- **ἐν ῥήματι (en rhēmati)** = **with the word**

---

### **Christ's Model:**

**1. SACRIFICIAL LOVE (v25)**
- Gave Himself up (ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν)
- NOT conditional on church's behavior
- Loved WHILE she was sinful (Rom 5:8)

**2. SANCTIFYING PURPOSE (v26)**
- Goal: Set her apart (ἁγιάσῃ)
- Method: **THE WORD** (ἐν ῥήματι) - Scripture, not force
- Cleanses through truth

**3. GOAL: SPOTLESS (v27)**
- Without spot or wrinkle (μὴ ἔχουσαν σπίλον ἢ ῥυτίδα)
- Holy and blemishless (ἁγία καὶ ἄμωμος)
- Christ cares about church's HOLINESS

---

### **Application to Wife in Sin:**

✅ **Care about her holiness** (ἁγιάσῃ)  
✅ **Use THE WORD** (ἐν ῥήματι - Scripture, not force)  
✅ **Keep loving** (ἀγαπᾶτε - even while she has "spots")  
✅ **Goal: Restoration** (σπίλος removed)  

**NOT:**
❌ Ignore her sin (Christ cleanses, doesn't ignore)  
❌ Enable sin (codependency ≠ Christ's sanctifying work)  
❌ Harsh domination (method = word + sacrifice)  

---

### **Critical Text: Colossians 3:19**

> **"Husbands, Covenant-Love your wives, and do not be harsh with them."**

**Greek:**
> Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ μὴ πικραίνεσθε πρὸς αὐτάς

**Key:**
- **μὗ πικραίνεσθε (mē pikrainesthe)** = do NOT be harsh (**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**)
- Present imperative negative = NEVER do this
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** (even if wife in sin)

**What is πικραίνω?**

Scripture does NOT give detailed list. Context (Eph 5:29 "nourish and cherish") indicates opposite required.

**What we know:**
- Whatever violates "nourish and cherish" = πικραίνω
- Command is absolute (μή + present imperative)
- Applies even when wife in sin

---

### **Supporting Text: 1 Peter 3:7**

> **"Likewise, husbands, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the covenant-favor of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered."**

**Greek:**
> Οἱ ἄνδρες ὁμοίως συνοικοῦντες κατὰ γνῶσιν, ὡς ἀσθενεστέρῳ σκεύει τῷ γυναικείῳ ἀπονέμοντες τιμήν, ὡς καὶ συγκληρονόμοις χάριτος ζωῆς, εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐγκόπτεσθαι τὰς προσευχὰς ὑμῶν

**Key Terms:**
- **κατὰ γνῶσιν (kata gnōsin)** = according to knowledge
- **ἀπονέμοντες τιμήν (aponemontes timēn)** = giving honor (present participle - keep doing)
- **ἐγκόπτεσθαι (enkoptesthai)** = be hindered

**Critical:**
- **Give honor** (present tense = keep giving, NOT conditional)
- Even if wife in sin
- Warning: If you fail, **God will not hear your prayers**

---

### **How to Address Wife's Sin: Galatians 6:1**

> **"Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."**

**Greek:**
> Ἀδελφοί, ἐὰν καὶ προλημφθῇ ἄνθρωπος ἔν τινι παραπτώματι, ὑμεῖς οἱ πνευματικοὶ καταρτίζετε τὸν τοιοῦτον ἐν πνεύματι πραΰτητος, σκοπῶν σεαυτόν, μὴ καὶ σὺ πειρασθῇς

**Key Terms:**
- **καταρτίζω (katartizō)** = restore, mend
- **πραΰτης (prautēs)** = **GENTLENESS**
- **σκοπῶν σεαυτόν (skopōn seauton)** = keep watch on yourself

**Process:**

1. **Qualification:** Be spiritual (Spirit-led, not sinless)
2. **Goal:** RESTORE (mend, not punish)
3. **Method:** GENTLENESS (πραΰτης)
4. **Self-examination:** Watch yourself (pride, harshness temptations)

---

### **Matthew 7:3-5 - Log in Own Eye**

> **"Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly."**

**Greek:**
> ὑποκριτά, ἔκβαλε πρῶτον ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σοῦ τὴν δοκόν, καὶ τότε διαβλέψεις ἐκβαλεῖν τὸ κάρφος

**Key:**
- **πρῶτον (prōton)** = **FIRST**
- **τότε (tote)** = **THEN** (only then)

**Before addressing wife's sin:**
1. Examine YOUR sin FIRST
2. Confess YOUR sin
3. Remove YOUR log
4. THEN (only then) help with her speck

---

### **Summary: Husband When Wife in Sin**

✅ Care about holiness (Eph 5:26-27)  
✅ Use THE WORD (ἐν ῥήματι - Scripture)  
✅ Give honor (1 Pet 3:7)  
✅ Restore gently (Gal 6:1)

⛔ Correcting while in unrepentant sin (Matt 7:5)  

**WARNING:**
⚠️ If you dishonor wife → God will not hear prayers (1 Pet 3:7)

---

# **SCENARIO 3: HUSBAND IN REBELLION**

## **When Does Submission End?**

### **Acts 5:29 - Obey God Rather Than Men**

> **"We must obey God rather than men."**

**Greek:**
> πειθαρχεῖν δεῖ θεῷ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀνθρώποις

**Principle:**
- God's authority > human authority (always)
- When husband commands SIN → obey God instead

---

### **When Husband Commands Sin:**

**IF husband commands:**
- Worship idol (1st commandment)
- Commit adultery (7th commandment)
- Lie under oath (9th commandment)
- Abandon church assembly (Heb 10:25)

**THEN wife MUST:**
✅ Obey God rather than husband (Acts 5:29)  
✅ Refuse to sin  
✅ Accept consequences  

**BUT STILL:**
✅ Respectful refusal (Dan 3:16 - "O king")  
✅ No rebellion for rebellion's sake  
✅ Trust God for deliverance  

---

### **1 Peter 3:1 Still Applies**

Even if husband in rebellion:
- "Even if some do not obey the word" (ἀπειθοῦσιν τῷ λόγῳ)
- May still be "won without word" (ἄνευ λόγου κερδηθήσονται)
- By wife's conduct (ἀναστροφή)

---

### **When Is Separation Permitted?**

**1 Corinthians 7:10-11:**

> **"The wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband)."**

**Greek:**
> γυναῖκα ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς μὴ χωρισθῆναι – ἐὰν δὲ καὶ χωρισθῇ, μενέτω ἄγαμος ἢ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω

**Key:**
- **General command:** DO NOT SEPARATE
- **IF separation happens:** Two options only
  1. Remain unmarried (μενέτω ἄγαμος)
  2. Be reconciled (καταλλαγήτω)
- No remarriage permitted

**When might separation be warranted?**

Scripture does NOT give explicit list. Principles suggest:
- IF he abandons (1 Cor 7:15 - "not enslaved")
- Severe unrepentant sin (1 Cor 5:11 principle)

**What separation is NOT:**
❌ Excuse to remarry  
❌ Permanent solution (goal = reconciliation)  
❌ Escape from difficulty  

---

### **Summary: Wife When Husband in Rebellion**

**GENERAL RULE:**
✅ Stay (1 Pet 3:1)  
✅ Win without word  
✅ Pure conduct  
✅ Trust God  

**EXCEPTIONS:**
✅ IF commands sin → Refuse (Acts 5:29)  
✅ IF abandons → Not enslaved (1 Cor 7:15)  

**IF SEPARATED:**
✅ Remain unmarried  
✅ Seek reconciliation  
✅ Pray for repentance  

**NEVER:**
❌ Remarry (unless he dies)  
❌ Separate for trivial reasons  
❌ Give up hope  

---

# **SCENARIO 4: WIFE IN REBELLION**

## **Husband's Responsibility Continues**

### **Ephesians 5:25 - Love Not Conditional**

> **"Husbands, Covenant-Love your wives, as Christ Covenant-Loved the Covenant-Assembly."**

**Critical:**
- NO condition given (NOT "IF she submits")
- Christ loved church WHILE sinful (Rom 5:8)
- Command to love continues even if wife rebellious

---

### **Church Discipline Process: Matthew 18:15-17**

**Four-Step Process:**

**STEP 1:** Private confrontation (μεταξὺ μόνου)  
**STEP 2:** Bring witnesses (ἕνα ἢ δύο)  
**STEP 3:** Tell church (εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ)  
**STEP 4:** Treat as unbeliever (ὡσπερ ὁ ἐθνικός)  

**Application to Wife in Rebellion:**
1. Private, gentle confrontation (Gal 6:1)
2. Godly witnesses (elders, mature women - Titus 2:3-4)
3. Church discipline (formal process)
4. Separation (last resort)

---

### **1 Corinthians 5:11 - Do Not Associate**

> **"Not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one."**

**Greek:**
> μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι... τῷ τοιούτῳ μηδὲ συνεσθίειν

**IF wife professes Christ BUT:**
- Sexually immoral (πόρνος)
- Greedy/covetous (πλεονέκτης - idolatry per Col 3:5)
- Idolater (εἰδωλολάτρης)
- Verbally abusive (λοίδορος)
- Drunkard (μέθυσος)
- Swindler (ἅρπαξ)

**AND refuses church discipline:**

THEN separation warranted (μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι)  
Goal: Repentance (1 Cor 5:5)  
BUT remain married (1 Cor 7:10-11)  

---

### **What Husband May NOT Do**

**Even if wife rebellious:**

⛔ Be harsh (Col 3:19)  
⛔ Dishonor (1 Pet 3:7)  
⛔ Stop loving (Eph 5:25)  
⛔ Divorce (except πορνεία - Matt 19:9)  

---

### **Matthew 19:9 - Divorce Exception**

> **"Whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."**

**Greek:**
> ὃς ἂν ἀπολύσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ καὶ γαμήσῃ ἄλλην μοιχᾶται

**Key:**
- **πορνεία (porneia)** = sexual immorality
- General rule: NO DIVORCE
- Exception: πορνεία only
- Rebellion alone ≠ grounds for divorce

---

### **Summary: Husband When Wife in Rebellion**

**CONTINUE:**
✅ Covenant-Love (NOT conditional)  
✅ Give honor  
✅ Care about holiness  
✅ Use the WORD  
✅ Gentle restoration  

**PROCESS:**
1. Private confrontation
2. Witnesses
3. Church discipline
4. Separation (last resort)

**FORBIDDEN:**
⛔ Harshness  
⛔ Dishonor  
⛔ Stop loving  
⛔ Divorce (except πορνεία)  

**GOAL:**
✅ Repentance  
✅ Reconciliation  
✅ Sanctification  

---

# **⚖️ CONCLUSION**

## **The Christ + Church Model**

**Ephesians 5:32:**
> **"This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the Covenant-Assembly."**

**Marriage = Icon of Christ + Church:**
- Husband reflects Christ (head, lover, sanctifier)
- Wife reflects Church (body, beloved, sanctified)
- Both fall short
- Both called to reflect Christ in their roles

**Christ's Example:**
- Loved church WHILE sinful
- Gave Himself WHILE rebellious
- Sanctified BY THE WORD
- Goal: Spotless bride

**Application:**
- Husband loves even if wife sins/rebels
- Wife submits even if husband sins/rebels
- Both trust God to change the other

---

## **What Scripture Gives:**

✅ Hard commands (submit even if disobedient, love even if rebellious)  
✅ Hope of winning spouse (1 Pet 3:1, Eph 5:26-27)  
✅ Process for severe cases (Matt 18:15-17, 1 Cor 5:11)  
✅ Warnings (1 Pet 3:7 - prayers hindered)  

## **What Scripture Does NOT Give:**

❌ Easy way out  
❌ Permission to abandon quickly  
❌ Conditional love  
❌ Excuse for harshness
