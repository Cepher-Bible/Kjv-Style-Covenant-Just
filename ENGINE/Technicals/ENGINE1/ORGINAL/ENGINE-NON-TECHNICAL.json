COMPRESSION LAYER (70 → 12 → 3 → 1)
12 Foundational Cords (Irreducible)
God is Creator and King
Life belongs to God (life-breath issued, withdrawn by Him)
Humanity bears image + responsibility
Torah is God’s revealed will, not human wisdom
Sin is rebellion, not ignorance
Death is verdict, not illusion
Blood covers life (substitution, not metaphor)
Covenant governs relationship (not sentiment)
Turning (teshuvah) precedes restoration
Covenant-justice is declared by God, not earned
Wisdom begins with holy dread, not knowing
Final verdict belongs to the King (resurrection + judgment)
3 Primary Axes
LIFE — God gives life-breath; sustained by obedience; restored by blood and turning; fulfilled in resurrection
COVENANT — God binds Himself by word; defines justice; defines blessing and curse; culminates in Christ
VERDICT — God judges rightly; works testify, not save; resurrection confirms verdict; eternal outcomes real
1 Single Standing Truth
God alone gives life, defines covenant-justice, and renders final verdict —
and man lives or dies by covenant faithfulness to Him.
Integrity Check
Wisdom never outranks holy dread
Knowing never precedes obedience
Faith never nullifies covenant
Grace never cancels verdict
Love never abolishes holiness
Seed → Tree holds.
Torah → Christ holds.
Cross → Crown holds.
COLLISION RULES (ENFORCED)
Life-Breath > Soul (creation/renewal)
Turning > Desire (no covenant flattening)
Covenant-Justice > righteousness/justice split
Hammered Sky > firmament/expanse
Holy Breath / Spirit-Breath precision enforced
Sons of God never softened
Slave > servant (total allegiance)
Wrath > anger/displeasure
Holy Dread > reverence/awe alone
Verdict > accountability/consequence
Afterlife Compartments > generic "hell" flattening
Immutable always overrides cadence.
