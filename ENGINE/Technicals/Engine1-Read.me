Engine1 — Canonical Trunk Engine
Version: 1.0.0-TRUNK
Philosophy: Seed-to-Tree / Heat-Restored

Purpose
Engine1 is the canonical floor engine for a 66-book Scripture system. It exists to preserve authorial unity, narrative sequence, and covenant continuity without speculative overlays or retroactive prophecy injection. Its job is stability, not flourish.

This engine assumes: • One Author
• One unfolding story
• Progressive revelation
• No semantic vapor
• No flattening of time

Engine1 is designed to be safe as a default, auditable in doctrine, and resistant to drift.

Core Design Principles
Seed-to-Tree means meaning grows forward, not backward. Later revelation clarifies earlier texts but does not overwrite their historical voice.

Heat-Restored means words retain embodied, concrete force rather than being abstracted into theological vapor.

No global overlays. No hidden harmonics. No speculative prophecy engines.

Immutable Locks
The following terms are fixed to prevent dilution or ideological drift. Locks constrain rendering, not genre.

Firmament → Hammered Sky (raqia)
Righteousness → Covenant-Justice
Justice → Covenant-Justice
Spirit → Spirit-Breath
Soul → Life-Breath (nephesh)
Repentance → Turning (teshuvah)
Subdue → Ordered Authority
Grace → Covenant-Faithfulness
Mercy → Covering-Mercy

Locks ensure covenant coherence across Torah, Prophets, Writings, Gospels, and Epistles.

Cadence-Flexible Terms
Some terms require contextual range without loss of fidelity. These are constrained, not free-floating.

Glory
• Glory Weight
• Substance of Presence

Hell / Afterlife Contexts
• Grave of the dead → Sheol / Hades
• Judgment fire → Gehenna
• Fallen angels → Tartarus
• Cosmic void / restraint → The Abyss

Servant
• Slave (doulos / ebed)

Fear of the Lord
• Holy Dread

Love
• Covenant-Love (agape)
• Friend-Affection (philia)

Cadence flexibility allows Scripture to speak with its own voice while staying inside canonical bounds.

Wisdom Stack Enforcement
Interpretation follows a fixed moral-epistemic order.

Sequence: Knowing (relational awareness)
Holy Dread (reverent constraint)
Wisdom (right processing)
Understanding (structural clarity)
Counsel (direction)
Knowledge (applied insight)
Covenant-Justice Action (fruit)

Validation Rule:
FAIL_IF_KNOWLEDGE_PRECEDES_DREAD

This rule exists to prevent purely technical or academic mastery from outrunning reverence.

What Engine1 Does Not Do
• No prophetic overlay engine
• No harmonic polysemy selector
• No retroactive fulfillment forcing
• No genre flattening
• No abstraction-first theology
• No speculative typology injection

Engine1 deliberately avoids power tools that can rewrite Scripture under the banner of “depth.”

Intended Use
• Default translation baseline
• Canonical audit reference
• Teaching and study foundations
• Overlay host (future engines must submit to Engine1 constraints)

Engine1 should always run first. Any higher-order engine must prove non-violation of Engine1 outputs.

Threat Model
Engine1 is hardened against: • Marcionism
• Supersessionist drift
• Allegorical vaporization
• Doctrinal flattening
• Time-collapse prophecy abuse
• Reader-centric reinterpretation

Summary
Engine1 is not flashy. It is faithful.

It preserves the Bible as a story that moves, a covenant that unfolds, and a voice that speaks in history before it echoes in fulfillment.

This engine is the trunk.
Everything else is branches.
