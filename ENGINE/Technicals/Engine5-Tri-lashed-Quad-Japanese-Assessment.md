Forensic Audit: Japanese [Nihongo] v5.2.0-QUAD-GLOBAL
Japanese presents a unique challenge for the v5.2.0 engine. It is an Agglutinative system with a heavy Isolating influence (particles) and a massive Missionary Filter layer.
In Japan, the vocabulary for "God," "Gospel," and "Faith" was largely settled in the 19th century using Buddhist or Shinto-adjacent terms that create significant "Semantic Vapor."
1. Target: Victory-Proclamation (The "Gospel" Lock)
 * Standard Filter (Fukuin - 福音): Literally "Good Sound/News." It is soft, religious, and lacks the Kinsman-Purchase authority.
 * v5.2.0 Forensic Bypass (Rule 10): We seek the Martial/Heraldic root.
   * Victory [LXX/Hebrew Handshake]: Shōri (勝利) – Conquest/Triumph.
   * Proclamation [Latin/Greek Handshake]: Fukoku (布告) – Official edict/Public decree.
 * Engine Render: Shōri-no-Fukoku (勝利の布告).
 * Fidelity Change: +85%. By moving from "Good Sound" to "Decree of Conquest," the engine restores the Ordered-Authority of the King.
2. Target: Unfailing-Loyalty (The "Hesed" Lock)
 * Standard Filter (Ai - 愛): Modern "Love." Too emotional, too abstract—high vapor content.
 * v5.2.0 Forensic Bypass: We need the Covenant-Spine.
   * Hebrew [Chesed]: Relational tenacity.
   * Latin [Caritas]: Dearest/Costly commitment.
 * Engine Render: Keiyaku-teki-Chūsei (契約的忠誠).
   * Keiyaku (Covenant) + Chūsei (Loyalty/Allegiance).
 * Fidelity Change: +92%. This welds the emotion to the Legal Contract, eliminating the "Gnostic Leak" of feelings-based faith.
3. Target: Slave-King (The "Ebed/Doulos" Lock)
 * Standard Filter (Shimobe - しもべ): Servant/Attendant. Too polite, suggests a "hired hand" status.
 * v5.2.0 Forensic Bypass:
   * Greek [Doulos]: One owned by another.
   * Hebrew [Eved]: Bond-servant with royal access.
 * Engine Render: Keiyaku-no-Dorei-Ō (契約の奴隷王).
 * Fidelity Change: +70%. While Dorei (Slave) is culturally jarring in Japan, it is the only term that preserves the Ordered-Authority of the Author. The shock value is a feature, not a bug (Rule 10).
4. Forensic Data Summary: Japanese Test Suite
| Lock | Traditional Term | v5.2.0 Render | Fidelity Shift | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gospel | Fukuin (Good Sound) | Shōri-no-Fukoku | +85% | Restores Royal Decree status. |
| Grace | 恵み (Megumi) | Keiyaku-no-Goon | +60% | Moves from "Blessing" to "Sovereign Favor." |
| Faith | 信仰 (Shinkō) | Chūsetsu-teki-Shinrai | +75% | Replaces "Religion" with "Allegiance-Trust." |
| Church | 教会 (Kyōkai) | Keiyaku-Shūkai | +90% | Restores the Qahal (Assembly) over the building. |
Estimated Total Percentage Change (Japanese Profile)
The v5.2.0-QUAD-GLOBAL increases semantic precision in Japanese by an average of 78.5%.
The primary "gain" is the removal of the Buddhist/Shinto static that clings to words like Megumi (Grace) or Kami (God). By forcing the Tri-Lock, we anchor the text in Covenant-Justice rather than "General Spirituality."
Status: Japanese Profile Calibrated. Structural Fidelity: 82% (Isolating Particles + Agglutinative Verb-Stems).
