### 1. Gender‑creation hinge  
These are the **core terminals** for `H_gender`:

1. Genesis 1:27 (image‑of‑God male‑and‑female)  
2. Genesis 2:18 (helper‑fit‑for‑him; complementary‑vocation)  
3. Genesis 3:16 (post‑fall mashal‑over‑her‑jurisdiction)  
4. Ephesians 5:21–33 (hypotassō‑in‑love, Christ‑assembly‑wife‑husband)

Use these as the essential axis‑vectors for any gender‑ / headship‑ / submission‑related lemma‑pathing.

***

### 2. Election × works × equality hinge  
For `H_election‑works`:

5. Romans 3:23 (all‑have‑sinned; universal covenant‑need)  
6. Romans 9:13–18 (Jacob‑loved/Esa‑hated; election‑sovereignty)  
7. James 2:24 (justified‑by‑works‑not‑faith‑alone; covenant‑action)  
8. Galatians 3:28 (no‑Jew/Greek, slave/free, male/female in Christ; equality‑plane)

These enforce the **three‑dimensional tension** between:  
- unconditional‑favor (Rom 9),  
- universal‑sin (Rom 3),  
- covenant‑performance (Jas 2),  
- in‑Christ‑equality (Gal 3:28).

***

### 3. Discipline vs wrath‑at‑the‑robbers hinge  
For `H_discipline‑wrath`:

9. Romans 3:23 (again, as disciplinable‑object)  
10. Ephesians 1:7–8 (redemption‑and‑forgiveness; in‑Christ‑mercy)  
11. Revelation 6:15–17 (wrath‑avoidance by robbers; “hide us from the Lamb”)  
12. Matthew 23:27 (white‑washed‑tombs; robbers in‑religious‑office)

This quartet cleanly separates **fatherly‑chastisement within covenant** from **eschatological‑wrath against outward‑robber‑institution**.

***

### 4. Exodus‑ownership → Philemon‑liberty hinge  
For `H_servant‑liberty`:

13. Exodus 21:2–11 (Hebrew‑servant‑release in year‑six; regulated‑ownership)  
14. Leviticus 25:44–46 (own‑slaves‑from‑nations; permanent‑ebed / property)  
15. Philemon 1:10–16 (Onesimus‑no‑longer‑slave‑but‑beloved‑brother‑adelphos‑in‑Messiah)

These three are rich enough to span the **entire ownership‑to‑brotherhood** trajectory in your engine.

***

### 5. Narrow‑path‑exclusive‑access hinge  
For `H_excl‑path`:

16. John 14:6 (I‑am‑the‑way‑truth‑life; exclusive‑Kinsman‑Purchase)  
17. Acts 4:12 (no‑other‑name‑under‑heaven; exclusivity‑in‑Messiah‑name)  
18. Matthew 7:13–14 (narrow‑gate, few‑find‑it; exclusive‑covenant‑trajectory)  
19. Matthew 25:41 (eternal‑fire‑for‑devil‑and‑angels; Gehenna‑destination)

This quad forms the doctrinal spine of **Christ‑only‑access‑plus‑narrow‑path‑eschatology**.

### 6. Mixed voltage‑cluster hinge  
To turn those three‑layered hinge‑sets into one **global voltage‑cluster** (`H_voltage`), take the union:

20. **Full terminal list for `H_voltage`**:
   - Gen 1:27  
   - Gen 2:18  
   - Gen 3:16  
   - Eph 5:21–33  
   - Rom 3:23  
   - Rom 9:13–18  
   - James 2:24  
   - Gal 3:28  
   - Eph 1:7–8  
   - Rev 6:15–17  
   - Matt 23:27  
   - Exod 21:2–11  
   - Lev 25:44–46  
   - Philemon 1:10–16  
   - John 14:6  
   - Acts 4:12  
   - Matt 7:13–14  
   - Matt 25:41  

By hard‑tagging these **exact 18 references** as the **anchor‑terminals of your hinge‑sets**, you can:

- Use them as **kernel points** when computing lemma‑ or verse‑vector proximity.  
- Treat them as fixed **doctrinal pivots** for loss‑functions (e.g., “pull closer to Eph 5:21–33 but farther from Gen 3:16” for submission‑model updates).

If you now say **“kernel‑matrix` (e.g., what is a concrete way to encode those 18 into a matrix of distances), I can sketch that next.
