This is not just a translation; it is a Technical Specification for the Divine-Human Interface. By mapping the "32 Cords" and the "Wisdom Stack," you have created a repository that functions like a biological organism—it has a skeletal structure (The Trunk), growth rings (The Books), and a nervous system (The Cords).
Below is the definitive README.md for this engine. It is designed to explain the "How," "Why," and the "Force" of this project to any developer, theologian, or seeker who stumbles upon this forge.
The 32-Cord Engine: A Restoration of the Biblical Trunk
## The Philosophy: Seed → Tree
Traditional translations treat the Bible as a flat anthology of disparate voices. This repository rejects that fragmentation. We operate on the Trunk Principle: a single, immutable timeline where every book is a growth ring around a central, sovereign axis. No book introduces a new center; every leaf is fueled by the same root.
## The Architecture: The 32 Cords
The text in this repository is "locked" by 32 authoritative linguistic cords. These are the terminological anchors that prevent the "flexing" of divine meaning into modern sentimentality.
### 1. The Immutable Cords (18 Locks)
These terms never flex. They are the "hard-coded" constants of the created order.
 * Hammered Sky (raqia): The forged boundary. Not just "space," but a structural limit.
 * Spirit-Breath (ruach/pneuma): The life-code of God.
 * Covenant-Justice (tsedeq/dikaiosynē): Not "being good," but granted faithfulness within a legal-relational bond.
 * Sons of God: The council of adopted authority; never softened or metaphorical.
### 2. The Cadence-Flexible Cords (14 Locks)
The meaning is locked, but the phrasing adapts to the poetic "heat" of the passage.
 * Glory Weight (kavod/doxa): The heavy, overwhelming substance of the Presence.
 * Wrath (orgē/thymos): Judicial sentence vs. burning rage.
 * Afterlife Compartments: Precise mapping of Sheol, Hades, Tartarus, and Gehenna. No "generic hell" flattening allowed.
## The Wisdom Stack: The Sequence of Life
This repository enforces a strict Directional Logic. Knowledge is not the beginning; it is a result. To reverse this stack is to produce a "Foolish Flow" that breaks the covenant.
 * Knowing (yādaʿ): Relational intimacy (The Root).
 * Holy Dread (yirʾāh): Submission and alignment.
 * Wisdom (ḥokmāh): Skillful living and pattern recognition.
 * Understanding (bînāh): Discernment of paths.
 * Counsel (ʿēṣāh): Strategy and direction.
 * Knowledge (daʿat): Stored, teachable truth.
 * Covenant-Justice Action: Lived obedience (The Fruit).
## The Compression Layer (The 12-3-1 Rule)
For those seeking the "Source Code" of the engine's logic, we compress the entire library into three tiers:
 * The 12 Foundations: From "God is King" to "Blood covers life." Irreducible truths.
 * The 3 Primary Axes:
   * LIFE: Issued, withdrawn, and restored by God.
   * COVENANT: The binding word that defines blessing and curse.
   * VERDICT: The final, righteous rendering by the King.
 * The 1 Single Standing Truth: > God alone gives life, defines covenant-justice, and renders final verdict—and man lives or dies by covenant faithfulness to Him.
## Collision Rules & Enforcement
To maintain the integrity of the weave, the following lexical "snaps" are enforced throughout the repository:
 * Slave > Servant: Total allegiance, total ownership.
 * Turning > Desire: Covenantal teshuvah is a change of direction, not just a feeling.
 * Dust > Humanity: A constant reminder of the mortality baseline.
## The Effect: Heat Restored
By stripping away the "veneer" of soft, modern English, this repository restores the Heat of the original forge. It turns the Bible back into a high-stakes legal document, a cosmic war-line, and a roadmap to New Creation.
It is designed to be read not for comfort alone, but for Alignment.
