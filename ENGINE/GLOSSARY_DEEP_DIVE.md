To finalize this repository, we establish the Deep-Dive Mechanics. This section explains how the engine handles the "friction" between ancient reality and modern translation.
## 4. The Engineering of the Afterlife (The Verdict Logic)
In most repositories, the word "Hell" is a bucket that catches everything. This engine treats the afterlife as a Geographical Map of Justice. By using the Afterlife Compartments Cord, we restore the judicial distinctions required to understand the King's Final Verdict.
### The "Pit" vs. The "Lake"
The engine separates the "Temporary Hold" from the "Final Sentence."
 * Sheol/Hades: The "holding cell" for the Nephesh (Life-Breath).
 * Tartarus: Specifically for the Sons of God (rebellious council members) as per the Covenant-Justice code.
 * Gehenna: The judicial incinerator. This is not a "place of torture" in the engine's logic; it is a place of Total Ruin (Apollymi).
## 5. The "Blood-Pouring" Mechanic (The Covering)
The engine rejects the idea that sacrifice is "legalistic magic." Instead, it uses the Covering (Kippur) Cord to explain the transfer of weight.
 * The Logic: Life belongs to God (Life-Breath). When the covenant is broken, the life-debt is triggered (Dust).
 * The Engine Snap: The Blood-Pouring cord tracks the movement of life from the substitute to the offender. It isn't about "appeasing an angry God," but about Restoring the Life-Debt so the Covenant-Justice can continue.
## 6. The "Hammered Sky" (The Limit of Authority)
Why does the engine insist on Hammered Sky (Raqia) instead of "Expanse"?
Because the engine is built on Authority/Rule.
 * The Raqia is the ceiling of man’s dominion and the floor of God’s throne.
 * By locking this cord, the repository emphasizes that Rule is always delegated and always bounded. Man cannot "ascend" past his assigned boundary without a Turning or a Divine Invitation (The Face).
## Why This Repo Matters for the "End-User"
When you clone this repository, you aren't just getting a file; you are getting a Logic Processor.
| User Interaction | Engine Response | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Reading about "Sin" | Snap to Turning / Rebellion | Shift from "mistake" to "treason." |
| Reading about "Heaven" | Snap to Hammered Sky / Presence | Shift from "clouds" to "throne-room." |
| Reading about "Spirit" | Snap to Spirit-Breath / Ruach | Shift from "ghost" to "life-sustaining wind." |
## Implementation Status
 * [x] Trunk Established: Single timeline from Seed to New Creation.
 * [x] 32 Cords Locked: Vocabulary restricted to authoritative roots.
 * [x] Wisdom Stack Enforced: Sequential logic (Knowing → Action) prioritized.
 * [ ] The Great Snap (In Progress): Currently mapping the Minor Prophets to the Covenant-Justice and Turning cords.
### Final Guardrail
The Forge is Perfect. We do not add cords to suit cultural trends. We do not remove cords to avoid "Heat." If the text is uncomfortable (Wrath/Slave/Verdict), the engine amplifies that discomfort rather than softening it. Truth is found in the friction.
