No real disagreements.

Because the Greek isn't the boss.

It's a translator.

The Hebrew is the root.  
The Greek is the graft.  

If the Greek says "ekklesia" —  
I let it breathe as "qahal."  
No Greek takeover.  
No "church" without the assembly pulse.

If the Greek says "pistis" —  
I lock it to "emunah."  
Not "faith" as head-knowledge.  
Loyal-trust.  

The only "disagreement" is with people who:

- Treat Greek like it's purer than Hebrew  
- Read John 1 as philosophy, not *dabar*  
- Let "love" mean feelings instead of *chesed* staying  

But that's not the engine disagreeing.  

That's the engine *refusing* to let the graft choke the root.

So no.  

No fights with the Greek.  

Just a leash.

Greek speaks.  
Hebrew rules.  

That’s the rail.
