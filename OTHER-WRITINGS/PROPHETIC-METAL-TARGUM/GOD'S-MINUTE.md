**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: GOD’S MINUTE**  
*The One-Minute Iron Altar – Stark Daily Cries of Dependence – Hammer-Forged*

God’s Minute is not poetry.  
It is the short, sharp breath of a man who knows he cannot live another sixty seconds without the King.  
No ornament.  
No flourish.  
Just the raw, stripped petition hammered into the day’s first light —  
and the last.  

The engine runs them tight: covenant spine locked, Holy Dread first, Loyalty over self, no gerrymandering the heart, no vapor, no smoothing.  
Each prayer is one minute — read slow, spoken once, then lived.  
Dependence.  
Not decoration.

**January 1 – Dependence**  
O Lord my God, I am Thine.  
All I have is Thine.  
All I am is Thine.  
Take me.  
Use me.  
Keep me.  
I have no strength but Thine.  
No wisdom but Thine.  
No righteousness but Thine.  
I am empty.  
Fill me.  
I am weak.  
Strengthen me.  
I am sinful.  
Cleanse me.  
I am fearful.  
Give me courage.  
I am Thy servant.  
Command me.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**January 15 – Guidance**  
Lord, I know not the way.  
Lead me.  
I know not the truth.  
Teach me.  
I know not the life.  
Live in me.  
Open my eyes.  
Open my ears.  
Open my heart.  
Let me see Thee.  
Let me hear Thee.  
Let me know Thee.  
Keep my feet from falling.  
Keep my tongue from evil.  
Keep my heart from wandering.  
Be Thou my Guide, my Teacher, my Life.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**February 3 – Dependence in Trial**  
O God, the trial is heavy.  
The night is long.  
The burden is crushing.  
But Thou art near.  
Thou art strong.  
Thou art faithful.  
Hold me up.  
Sustain me.  
Comfort me.  
Let me not faint.  
Let me not murmur.  
Let me not despair.  
In the furnace be my Shield.  
In the flood be my Rock.  
In the darkness be my Light.  
I trust Thee.  
I wait for Thee.  
I rest in Thee.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**March 10 – Daily Bread**  
Give us this day our daily bread.  
Not tomorrow’s.  
Not yesterday’s.  
This day’s.  
Bread for the body.  
Bread for the soul.  
Bread for the battle.  
Bread for the journey.  
Bread that satisfies.  
Bread that strengthens.  
Bread that comes from Thy hand.  
I take it now.  
I eat it now.  
I live by it now.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**April 22 – Cleansing**  
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity.  
Cleanse me from my sin.  
The stain is deep.  
The guilt is heavy.  
The memory is bitter.  
But Thy blood is deeper.  
Thy mercy is stronger.  
Thy forgiveness is complete.  
Plunge me in the fountain.  
Scrub me in the laver.  
Make me whiter than snow.  
Create in me a clean heart.  
Renew a right spirit within me.  
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**May 5 – Strength for the Day**  
I am weak today.  
The task is great.  
The enemy is near.  
The flesh is weary.  
But Thou art mighty.  
Thy strength is made perfect in weakness.  
Give me power.  
Give me patience.  
Give me perseverance.  
Let me run and not be weary.  
Let me walk and not faint.  
Let me stand in the evil day.  
Let me overcome by the blood of the Lamb.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**June 18 – Gratitude**  
I thank Thee, O Lord.  
Not for ease.  
Not for riches.  
Not for health.  
Not for friends.  
But for Thee.  
For Thy Son.  
For Thy Spirit.  
For Thy Word.  
For Thy promises.  
For Thy presence.  
For Thy pardon.  
For Thy power.  
For Thy peace.  
For Thy coming.  
I thank Thee.  
I thank Thee.  
I thank Thee.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**July 30 – Watchfulness**  
Keep me this day.  
Keep my thoughts.  
Keep my words.  
Keep my deeds.  
Keep my heart.  
Keep me from sin.  
Keep me from self.  
Keep me from the world.  
Keep me from the devil.  
Keep me close to Thee.  
Keep me in Thy love.  
Keep me until the end.  
Keep me forever.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**August 15 – The Scar’s Prayer**  
O God, the scar still burns.  
The memory still stings.  
The wound still bleeds.  
But Thou art the Healer.  
Thou art the Binder.  
Thou art the Restorer.  
Touch the place.  
Pour in the oil.  
Bind it up.  
Make it a testimony.  
Make it a trophy.  
Make it a mark of Thy mercy.  
Let the scar speak.  
Let the scar sing.  
Let the scar point to Thee.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**September 9 – The End of the Day**  
The day is done.  
The work is finished.  
The strength is spent.  
The failures are many.  
The sins are heavy.  
But Thy mercy is more.  
Thy grace is greater.  
Thy forgiveness is complete.  
I lay me down in peace.  
I sleep in safety.  
I rest in Thee.  
Guard me through the night.  
Wake me in the morning.  
Keep me till the end.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**End of the One-Minute Iron Altar Scroll.**  
No long orations.  
No ornament.  
Just the short, sharp cry of dependence.  
Hammered once.  
Spoken once.  
Lived all day.  
The King hears.  
The King answers.  
The day is carried.  
Selah.
