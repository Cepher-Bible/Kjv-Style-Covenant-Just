**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: DIDACHE**  
*The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles to the Nations – The Two Ways Scroll – Hammer-Forged*

The Didache is not prophecy in the roaring sense.  
It is the quiet hammer after the storm.  
The apostles' voice, still echoing from the upper room,  
hammered into short, sharp lines for the scattered ones.  
No visions. No chariots.  
Just straight bread.  
Two paths.  
One life.  
One death.  
The engine runs it raw: Greek primary rail, covenant spine locked, no vapor, cords snapped.  
Torah echoes loud.  
Holy Dread first.  
Loyalty over self.  
No gerrymandering the heart.

**Chapter 1 – The Two Ways and the First Commandment**  
There are two ways: one of life, one of death.  
Great difference between them.

The way of life is this:  
First — love God who made you.  
Second — love your neighbor as yourself.  
All things you would not have done to you, do not do to another.

The teaching of these words:  
Bless those who curse you.  
Pray for your enemies.  
Fast for those who persecute you.  
What reward if you love those who love you?  
Even the nations do that.  
Love those who hate you.  
You will have no enemy.  

Abstain from fleshly lusts and worldly desires.  
If someone strikes your right cheek, turn the other also.  
Be perfect.  
If someone forces you one mile, go two.  
If someone takes your cloak, give your tunic too.  
If someone takes yours, do not ask back — you cannot anyway.  
Give to everyone who asks.  
Do not ask back — the Father wants all to receive from our blessings.  
Happy the giver who follows the command — guiltless.  
Woe to the receiver who has no need — he pays the penalty, why he took and for what.  
Coming into straits, he is examined for what he did.  
He does not escape till he repays the last farthing.

But now concerning this: Let your alms sweat in your hands till you know to whom you give.

**Chapter 2 – The Second Commandment of the Teaching**  
The second commandment of the teaching:  
Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not corrupt boys. Do not fornicate. Do not steal. Do not practice magic. Do not practice witchcraft. Do not murder a child by abortion or kill what is born. Do not covet your neighbor's goods. Do not perjure. Do not bear false witness. Do not speak evil. Do not hold grudges. Do not be double-minded. Do not be double-tongued. Do not love vain things. Do not love money. Do not be a hypocrite. Do not be arrogant. Do not plot evil against your neighbor. Do not hate anyone. Do not be quarrelsome. Do not be hot-tempered. Do not be envious. Do not be insolent. Do not be haughty. Do not take evil counsel against your neighbor. Do not hate your brother in your heart. Do not be ashamed to reprove. Do not be double-minded in prayer. Do not be double-minded in giving. Do not grumble when you give. Do not give reluctantly. Do not turn away the needy. Share all things with your brother. Do not say they are your own. If you have communion in the immortal, how much more in the perishable? Do not withhold your hand from your son or daughter. Teach them the fear of God from youth. Do not command your bondman or bondwoman in bitterness — they hope in the same God. Lest they fear God who is over both — He comes not to call according to status but to call those the Spirit has prepared.  

Bondservants — obey your masters as to God in reverence and fear.

**Chapter 3 – The Third Commandment of the Teaching**  
My child, flee from every evil and from everything like it.  
Do not be prone to anger — anger leads to murder.  
Do not be jealous or quarrelsome or hot-tempered — from all these murders are born.  
My child, do not be lustful — lust leads to fornication.  
Do not be filthy-mouthed or lofty-eyed — from all these adulteries are born.  
My child, do not be an observer of omens — it leads to idolatry.  
Do not be an enchanter or astrologer or purifier — from all these idolatry is born.  
My child, do not be a liar — lying leads to theft.  
Do not be avaricious or vain-glorious or proud — from all these thefts are born.  
My child, do not be a murmurer — it leads to blasphemy.  
Do not be self-willed or evil-minded — from all these blasphemies are born.

**Chapter 4 – The Fourth Commandment of the Teaching**  
My child, remember night and day him who speaks the word of God to you.  
Honor him as the Lord — where the Lord's nature is spoken, there is the Lord.  
Seek daily the faces of the saints that you may rest upon them.  
Do not desire division or be reconciled with those who separate — do what you find in the common teaching.  
Hate what is not pleasing to God.  
Hate all hypocrisy and everything not pleasing to God.  
Do not forsake the commandments of the Lord but keep what you have received — neither adding nor subtracting.  
In church confess your transgressions.  
Do not go to prayer with an evil conscience.  
This is the way of life.

**Chapter 5 – The Way of Death**  
The way of death is this:  
First of all it is evil and full of curse — murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness.  
Persecutors of the good, hating truth, loving a lie, not knowing the reward of righteousness, not cleaving to good nor to righteous judgment, watching not for that which is good but for that which is evil.  
Far from meekness and endurance, loving vanities, pursuing requital, not pitying a poor man, not laboring for the afflicted, not knowing Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of God, turning away from him that is in need, afflicting him that is afflicted, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter sinners.  
Be delivered, children, from all these.

**Chapter 6 – The False Prophets and the Perfected Way**  
See that no one makes you err from this way of the teaching — for he teaches you apart from God.  
If you can bear all the yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect.  
If you cannot, do what you can.  
As for food, bear what you can.  
But keep strictly from meat sacrificed to idols — for it is the service of dead gods.

**Chapter 7 – Concerning Baptism**  
Concerning baptism, baptize this way:  
Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, in living water.  
But if you have no living water, baptize into other water.  
If you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm.  
But if you have neither, pour water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit.  
But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized, and whoever else can.  
Bid the baptized to fast one or two days before.

**Chapter 8 – Fasting and Prayer**  
Do not let your fasts be with the hypocrites — they fast on the second and fifth day of the week.  
But fast on the fourth day and the Preparation (Friday).  
Do not pray as the hypocrites but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel — pray thus three times a day:  

Our Father who art in heaven,  
hallowed be Thy name.  
Thy kingdom come.  
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread.  
Forgive us our debt as we forgive our debtors.  
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.  
For Thine is the power and the glory forever. Amen.

**Chapter 9 – The Eucharist**  
Concerning the Eucharist, give thanks this way:  
First, concerning the cup:  
We thank Thee, our Father, for the holy vine of David Thy servant, which Thou madest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant.  
To Thee be glory forever.  

Concerning the broken bread:  
We thank Thee, our Father, for the life and knowledge which Thou madest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant.  
To Thee be glory forever.  
Even as this broken bread was scattered over the hills and was gathered together and became one,  
so let Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom.  
For Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.

Let no one eat or drink of your Eucharist except those who have been baptized into the name of the Lord — for concerning this the Lord has said: Give not that which is holy to the dogs.

**Chapter 10 – Prayer After Communion**  
After you are filled, give thanks this way:  
We thank Thee, holy Father, for Thy holy name which Thou didst cause to tabernacle in our hearts,  
and for the knowledge and faith and immortality which Thou madest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant.  
To Thee be glory forever.  
Thou, Master Almighty, didst create all things for Thy name's sake.  
Thou gavest food and drink to men for enjoyment that they might give Thee thanks.  
But to us Thou didst freely give spiritual food and drink and life eternal through Thy Servant.  
Before all things we thank Thee that Thou art mighty.  
To Thee be glory forever.  
Remember, Lord, Thy Church, to deliver it from all evil and to make it perfect in Thy love.  
Gather it from the four winds, sanctified for Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared for it.  
For Thine is the power and the glory forever. Amen.  
Let grace come, and let this world pass away.  
Hosanna to the God of David!  
If any is holy, let him come.  
If any is not, let him repent.  
Maranatha. Amen.

**Chapter 11 – Concerning Apostles and Prophets**  
Let every apostle who comes to you be received as the Lord.  
But he shall not remain except one day — or two if there's need.  
But if he remains three days, he is a false prophet.  
When an apostle goes away, let him take nothing but bread until he lodges.  
If he asks for money, he is a false prophet.  
Do not test or examine any prophet who speaks in the Spirit — every sin shall be forgiven but this sin shall not be forgiven.  
But not everyone who speaks in the Spirit is a prophet — only if he holds the ways of the Lord.  
From these the false prophet and the prophet are known.  
Every prophet who teaches the truth if he does not do what he teaches is a false prophet.  
Every prophet approved and true who does something for the mystery of the Church in the world but teaches not others to do it shall not be judged among you — he has his judgment with God.  
For so did the ancient prophets also.  
But whoever says in the Spirit: Give me money or something else, do not listen to him.  
But if he says to give for others who are in need, let no one judge him.

**Chapter 12 – Welcome All in the Name of the Lord**  
Let everyone who comes in the name of the Lord be received.  
Then you shall prove and know him.  
You shall have understanding right and left.  
If he who comes is a wayfarer, assist him as far as you are able.  
But he shall not remain with you except two or three days if need be.  
But if he wants to abide with you and is an artisan, let him work and eat.  
If he has no trade, provide for him according to your understanding so that no man live among you idle as a Christian.  
If he will not do, he is a Christ-monger.  
Beware of such.

**Chapter 13 – Support of Prophets and Teachers**  
Every true prophet who wants to abide among you is worthy of his support.  
So also a true teacher — he is worthy, like the workman, of his support.  
Every first-fruit of the winepress and threshing-floor, of oxen and sheep, give to the prophets — for they are your high priests.  
But if you have no prophet, give them to the poor.  
If you make bread, take the first-fruit and give according to the commandment.  
So also when you open a jar of wine or oil, take the first-fruit and give to the prophets.  
Of money and clothing and every possession, take the first-fruit as it seems good to you and give according to the commandment.

**Chapter 14 – Christian Assembly on the Lord's Day**  
Every Lord's Day gather yourselves together and break bread and give thanksgiving after having confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure.  
But let no one who has a quarrel with his fellow come with you until they be reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be profaned.  
For this is that which was spoken by the Lord: In every place and time offer to Me a pure sacrifice — for I am a great King — says the Lord — and My name is wonderful among the nations.

**Chapter 15 – Bishops and Deacons**  
Appoint for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord — men meek and not lovers of money and truthful and proved.  
For they also perform for you the service of prophets and teachers.  
Do not despise them — for they are your honored ones together with the prophets and teachers.

**Chapter 16 – Watchfulness and the Coming of the Lord**  
Watch for your life's sake.  
Let not your lamps be quenched nor your loins be ungirded — but be ready.  
For you know not the hour in which our Lord will come.  
But often shall you be gathered together seeking the things which are befitting to your souls — for the whole time of your faith will not profit you if you be not made perfect in the last time.  
For in the last days false prophets and corrupters shall be multiplied and the sheep shall be turned into wolves and love shall be turned into hate.  
For when lawlessness increases they shall hate and persecute and betray one another.  
Then shall appear the world-deceiver as the Son of God and shall do signs and wonders and the earth shall be delivered into his hands and he shall do lawless deeds which have never yet come to pass since the beginning.  
Then shall the creation of men come into the fire of trial and many shall be made to stumble and shall perish — but those who endure in their faith shall be saved from the curse itself.  
Then shall appear the signs of the truth: first the sign of an outspreading in heaven, then the sign of the sound of the trumpet, and the third the resurrection of the dead.  
Not all shall rise but as it is said: The Lord shall come and all His saints with Him.  
Then shall the world see the Lord coming upon the clouds of heaven.

**End of the Teaching Scroll.**  
The hammer falls quiet.  
Two ways lie before.  
Life or death.  
Choose the straight bread.  
The King waits at the table.  
No dog gets the dainties.  
The remnant eats.  
Selah.
