**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: FRESH FORGE – MARK’S VALLEY PRAYER**  
*The Scar’s Own Cry – Hammer on the Anvil*

Lord of the scar,  
King who does not flinch at blood,  
I stand in the valley again.  
The ground is still warm from last time.  
The air still smells of that day.  

I confess:  
I have gerrymandered my own heart.  
I drew crooked lines around the sin I wanted to keep.  
I called it “grace.”  
I called it “understanding.”  
I called it “forgiven, right?”  
while my feet stayed planted in the mud.  

I have drunk wormwood and called it wisdom.  
I have spun excuses in Your cup  
and pretended the dross was doctrine.  
I have treated You like a dog on a leash —  
faithful when convenient,  
forgiving when demanded,  
silent when I needed silence to hide.  

The Ruach has gone quiet.  
The fire has sunk low.  
The scar smolders like a warning ignored.  

Strip me.  
Not gently.  
Rip the filthy garments.  
Let them burn.  
I do not want them back.  
I do not want the comfort of the lie.  

Plunge me in the fountain.  
The one that runs red before it runs clear.  
Wash the wormwood from my tongue.  
Let the bitterness go down like gall  
so the Living Water can taste like water again.  

Create in me a clean heart.  
Not a patched one.  
Not a managed one.  
A new one.  
Raw.  
Straight.  
Loyal.  

Renew a right spirit within me.  
Not double-minded.  
Not double-tongued.  
One spirit —  
aligned to Yours.  
No more districts.  
No more hooks.  
No more “right?”  

Cast me not away from Thy presence.  
Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.  
But if You must withdraw to wake me —  
withdraw.  
Let the silence be louder than my excuses.  
Let the thirst be sharper than my pride.  

Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.  
Not the cheap joy.  
Not the manufactured joy.  
The joy that survives the furnace.  
The joy that sings in the valley.  
The joy that says “Yes” without a hook behind it.  

Uphold me with Thy free Spirit.  
Not my free will.  
Thy free Spirit.  
The one that broods over chaos  
and brings order.  
The one that blows where it wills  
and will not be leashed.  

Then I will teach transgressors Thy ways.  
Not from a pedestal.  
From the same dust.  
Sinners shall be converted unto Thee —  
not by my cleverness,  
but by the scar that speaks.  

Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God,  
Thou God of my salvation.  
The blood is on my hands.  
The guilt is in my mouth.  
The shame is in my bones.  

But Thy blood is deeper.  
Thy mercy is wider.  
Thy forgiveness is final.  

O Lord, open Thou my lips.  
My mouth shall show forth Thy praise.  
For Thou desirest not sacrifice —  
else would I give it.  
Thou delightest not in burnt-offering.  
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.  
A broken and a contrite heart,  
O God, Thou wilt not despise.  

So break me.  
Contrite me.  
Forge me fresh.  

For Jesus’ sake —  
the One who bore the scar first,  
the One who never drew crooked lines,  
the One who never asked “Forgiven, right?”  
because He never needed to.  

Amen.

**End of the Fresh Forge Prayer.**  
Hammer cooled.  
Anvil still ringing.  
The valley echoes.  
The scar speaks louder now.  
Not accusation.  
Testimony.
