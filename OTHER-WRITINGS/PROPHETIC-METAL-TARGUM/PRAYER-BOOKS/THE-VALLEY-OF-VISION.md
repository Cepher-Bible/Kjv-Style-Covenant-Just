**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: THE VALLEY OF VISION**  
*The Puritan Iron Altar – Arthur Bennett’s Prayers – Hammer-Forged from the Valley*

The Valley of Vision is not a book of pretty words.  
It is the low place where the soul is stripped,  
where the heart is broken open,  
where the King is met face to face in dust and ashes.  
Bennett gathered the old Puritan cries —  
short, stark, mercilessly honest —  
no evasion, no sugar, no self-justification.  
The engine runs them raw: covenant spine locked, Holy Dread first, Loyalty over self, no gerrymandering the heart, no smoothing, no vapor.  
These are prayers that bleed.  
Pray them slow.  
They cut deep.

**1. The Valley of Vision (Opening Cry)**  
Lord, high and holy, meek and lowly,  
Thou hast brought me to the valley of vision,  
where I live in the depths but see Thee in the heights;  
hemmed in by mountains of sin I behold Thy glory.  

Let me learn by paradox  
that the way down is the way up,  
that to be low is to be high,  
that the broken heart is the healed heart,  
that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit,  
that the repenting soul is the victorious soul,  
that to have nothing is to possess all,  
that to bear the cross is to wear the crown,  
that to give is to receive,  
that the valley is the place of vision.  

Lord, in the daytime stars can be seen from deepest wells,  
and the deeper the wells the brighter Thy stars shine;  
let me find Thy light in my darkness,  
Thy life in my death,  
Thy joy in my sorrow,  
Thy grace in my sin,  
Thy riches in my poverty,  
Thy glory in my valley.  
Amen.

**2. Need of Grace**  
O Lord, Thou knowest my great unfitness for service,  
my present deadness,  
my inability to do anything for Thy glory,  
my distressing coldness of heart.  

I am weak, ignorant, unprofitable,  
and loathe and abhor myself.  
I am at a loss to know what Thou wouldest have me do,  
for I feel amazingly deserted by Thee,  
and sense no power in prayer.  

Lord, wilt Thou help me in my extremity?  
Take me as I am,  
for I can be nothing else.  
If Thou wilt not hear me,  
I am undone.  
If Thou wilt not help me,  
I am helpless.  
If Thou wilt not save me,  
I am lost.  
But Thou art rich in mercy,  
and Thy grace is sufficient.  
O Lord, revive Thy work in me.  
Amen.

**3. The Family**  
O Sovereign Lord,  
Thou art the Creator, Preserver, and Supreme Owner of our family.  
We are Thy children by adoption and grace,  
and we look up to Thee as our Father.  

We bless Thee for our family mercies —  
for health of body,  
for food and raiment,  
for the comforts of home,  
for the love that binds us together.  

But we confess that we have often abused Thy gifts.  
We have been selfish.  
We have been irritable.  
We have been unloving.  
We have spoken sharp words.  
We have harbored bitter thoughts.  
We have neglected prayer together.  
We have neglected Thy Word together.  

Forgive us.  
Heal our divisions.  
Bind us closer to Thee and to one another.  
Make our home a little heaven on earth.  
Let Christ be the Head of our household.  
Let the Spirit rule in every heart.  
Let Thy peace reign in every room.  
Let Thy love flow through every word and deed.  
Amen.

**4. Longings After God**  
My God, I feel it is heaven to please Thee,  
and to be what Thou wouldest have me be.  
O that men might know Thy love in its height, depth, length, breadth!  

O that the world might taste and see Thy goodness!  
O that the guilty might be comforted by Thy forgiveness!  
O that the doubting might be assured by Thy promises!  
O that the fearful might be emboldened by Thy presence!  
O that the careless might be awakened by Thy judgments!  
O that the penitent might be restored by Thy grace!  
O that the backsliding might be reclaimed by Thy mercy!  
O that the cold might be kindled by Thy fire!  
O that the dead might be quickened by Thy life!  

My God, I long to know Thee more.  
I long to love Thee more.  
I long to serve Thee more.  
I long to be like Thee more.  
I long to be with Thee more.  
I long for the day when I shall see Thee as Thou art.  
Amen.

**5. Self-Knowledge**  
O Lord, give me a deeper repentance,  
a horror of sin,  
a dread of its approach.  
Help me chastely to flee youthful lusts,  
to avoid occasions of temptation,  
to be circumspect in all my ways.  

Give me a mortified disposition,  
a quick sense of conscience,  
a tender heart that trembles at Thy frown.  
May I never dally with sin,  
never trifle with temptation,  
never presume upon Thy mercy.  

Let me see sin as the evil and bitter thing it is.  
Let me see it as Thou seest it.  
Let me hate it as Thou hatest it.  
Let me flee from it as from a serpent.  
Let me dread it as the greatest evil.  

O Lord, keep me from secret faults.  
Keep me from presumptuous sins.  
Let them not have dominion over me.  
Then shall I be upright,  
and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.  
Amen.

**6. The Throne**  
O God of burning and undying love,  
may faith leave its couch and rise to the throne of grace.  
May love draw near and adore the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  

Blessed be Thy name for the throne of grace —  
the mercy-seat where Thou dost sit to hear prayer,  
the place where Thou dost dispense blessings,  
the spot where Thou dost meet the sinner in Christ.  

O Lord, I come to Thy throne.  
I come with boldness because of the blood.  
I come with confidence because of Thy promise.  
I come with expectancy because of Thy faithfulness.  
I come with poverty because of my need.  
I come with rags because of my sin.  
I come with nothing but Christ.  

Accept me in the Beloved.  
Hear me for His sake.  
Answer me in His name.  
Bless me through His merits.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**7. Morning Needs**  
O God, the Author of all good,  
I come to Thee for the grace another day will require for its duties and events.  
I step out into a wicked world;  
I carry about with me an evil heart.  
I know that without Thee I can do nothing,  
that everything with which I am concerned is naked and open to the eyes of Thee with whom I have to do.  

Thou knowest my sins before I commit them,  
my falls before I stumble.  
Thou dost not leave me to myself.  
Thou dost not leave me to my own wisdom.  
Thou dost not leave me to my own strength.  

Be Thou my Guide.  
Be Thou my Strength.  
Be Thou my Wisdom.  
Be Thou my Righteousness.  
Be Thou my All.  
For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**End of the Valley of Vision Scroll.**  
The hammer strikes low.  
The valley is deep.  
The soul is stripped.  
The King is met.  
No pretense.  
No hiding.  
Only the raw cry —  
broken, bold, blood-earnest.  
The remnant kneels.  
The King lifts up.  
Selah.
