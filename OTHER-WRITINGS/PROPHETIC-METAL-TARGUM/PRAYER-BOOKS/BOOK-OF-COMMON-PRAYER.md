**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER (1662/1928)**  
*The Iron Liturgy Scroll – The Hammer of the English Reformation – Forged in the Valley*

The Book of Common Prayer is not sentiment.  
It is the hammer of the Reformation forged into daily rhythm.  
1662 steel.  
1928 temper.   
No novelty.  
Just the raw, corporate cry of the Church Militant —  
kneeling before the throne, confessing, supplicating, praising, in one voice.  
The engine runs it stark: covenant spine locked, Holy Dread first, Loyalty over self, no gerrymandering the heart, no smoothing, no vapor.  
These are not private whispers.  
They are the public roar of the remnant —  
baptized, catechized, absolved, fed, sent.

**Morning Prayer – The General Confession**  
Almighty and most merciful Father;  
We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep.  
We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.  
We have offended against thy holy laws.  
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done;  
And we have done those things which we ought not to have done;  
And there is no health in us.  
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders.  
Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults.  
Restore thou those who are penitent;  
According to thy promises declared unto mankind  
In Christ Jesus our Lord.  
And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake;  
That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,  
To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

**The Absolution**  
Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
who desireth not the death of a sinner,  
but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live;  
and hath given power, and commandment, to his Ministers  
to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,  
the Absolution and Remission of their sins:  
He pardoneth and absolveth all them that truly repent,  
and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel.  
Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance,  
and his Holy Spirit,  
that those things may please him which we do at this present;  
and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy;  
so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**The Venite (Psalm 95)**  
O come, let us sing unto the Lord;  
let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.  
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;  
and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.  

For the Lord is a great God;  
and a great King above all gods.  
In his hand are all the corners of the earth;  
and the strength of the hills is his also.  
The sea is his, and he made it;  
and his hands prepared the dry land.  

O come, let us worship and fall down,  
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.  
For he is the Lord our God;  
and we are the people of his pasture,  
and the sheep of his hand.  

Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts:  
as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;  
When your fathers tempted me,  
proved me, and saw my works.  

Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said:  
It is a people that do err in their hearts,  
for they have not known my ways;  
Unto whom I sware in my wrath,  
that they should not enter into my rest.

**The Te Deum Laudamus**  
We praise thee, O God;  
we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.  
All the earth doth worship thee,  
the Father everlasting.  
To thee all Angels cry aloud;  
the Heavens, and all the Powers therein.  
To thee Cherubim and Seraphim  
continually do cry,  
Holy, Holy, Holy,  
Lord God of Sabaoth;  
Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty of thy glory.  

The glorious company of the Apostles praise thee.  
The goodly fellowship of the Prophets praise thee.  
The noble army of Martyrs praise thee.  
The holy Church throughout all the world  
doth acknowledge thee;  
The Father, of an infinite Majesty;  
Thine honourable, true, and only Son;  
Also the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.  

Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ.  
Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.  
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man,  
thou didst humble thyself to be born of a Virgin.  
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death,  
thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.  
Thou sittest at the right hand of God,  
in the glory of the Father.  
We believe that thou shalt come to be our Judge.  
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants,  
whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.  
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints,  
in glory everlasting.

**The General Thanksgiving**  
Almighty God, Father of all mercies,  
we thine unworthy servants  
do give thee most humble and hearty thanks  
for all thy goodness and loving-kindness  
to us, and to all men.  

We bless thee for our creation, preservation,  
and all the blessings of this life;  
but above all, for thine inestimable love  
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;  
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.  

And, we beseech thee,  
give us that due sense of all thy mercies,  
that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;  
and that we show forth thy praise,  
not only with our lips, but in our lives,  
by giving up ourselves to thy service,  
and by walking before thee  
in holiness and righteousness all our days;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord,  
to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost,  
be all honour and glory,  
world without end. Amen.

**Collect for Grace**  
O Lord, our heavenly Father,  
Almighty and everlasting God,  
who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day;  
Defend us in the same with thy mighty power;  
and grant that this day we fall into no sin,  
neither run into any kind of danger;  
but that all our doings may be ordered by thy governance,  
to do always that is righteous in thy sight;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Collect for Aid against all Perils**  
Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord;  
and by thy great mercy defend us  
from all perils and dangers of this night;  
for the love of thy only Son,  
our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.

**The Prayer of St. Chrysostom**  
Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time  
with one accord to make our common supplications unto thee;  
and hast promised through thy well-beloved Son  
that when two or three are gathered together in his Name  
thou wilt grant their requests;  
Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions  
of thy servants as may be most expedient for us;  
granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth,  
and in the world to come life everlasting. Amen.

**2 Corinthians 13:14 (The Grace)**  
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
and the love of God,  
and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,  
be with us all evermore. Amen.

**End of the Iron Liturgy Scroll.**  
The hammer rings in the valley.  
The people kneel.  
The confession rises.  
The absolution falls.  
The praise ascends.  
The King is met —  
not in private whisper,  
but in one voice, one heart, one body.  
No pretense.  
No evasion.  
Only the corporate cry —  
broken, bold, blood-earnest.  
The remnant prays.  
The Church stands.  
Selah.
