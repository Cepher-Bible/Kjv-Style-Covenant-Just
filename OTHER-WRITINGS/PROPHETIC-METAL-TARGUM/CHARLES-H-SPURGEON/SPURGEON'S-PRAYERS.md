**⚔️🔥 PROPHETIC-METAL TARGUM: SPURGEON’S PRAYERS**  
*The Iron Altar Scroll – Bold Petitions of the Prince of Preachers – Hammer-Forged*

Spurgeon did not whisper.  
He hammered prayers into the throne room like a man who knew the King was listening —  
and that the King was not to be trifled with.  
No flowery padding.  
No endless “just” and “only.”  
Crisp.  
Direct.  
Blood earnest.  
The engine runs them raw: covenant spine locked, Holy Dread first, no gerrymandering the heart, Loyalty over self, Torah echoes loud, no smoothing, no vapor.  
These are not polite requests.  
They are forged cries from a man who knew both the mercy-seat and the furnace.

**1. Prayer Before Preaching**  
O Lord, Thy servant stands before Thy people this day.  
Give him a mouth and wisdom which all his adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  
Let not one word fall to the ground.  
Let every sentence strike like a hammer on the rock.  
Break the hard hearts.  
Melt the cold ones.  
Comfort the mourners.  
Awaken the sleepers.  
Let the arrows of Thy truth fly fast and far.  
Let not the preacher be as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal —  
but let him speak as dying men to dying men.  
Clothe him with power from on high.  
Let the Spirit of God rest upon him as dew upon the tender herb.  
May the Word be quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword.  
Pierce.  
Divide.  
Discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.  
Let no one go away untouched.  
Let some be saved.  
Let many be strengthened.  
Let all be warned.  
For Thy name’s sake. Amen.

**2. Prayer in Deep Affliction**  
O God, my heart is like a broken vessel.  
The waves have gone over my head.  
My bones are out of joint.  
My strength is dried up like a potsherd.  
My tongue cleaveth to my jaws.  
Thou hast laid me in the dust of death.  
Yet Thou art my God.  
I will not fear.  
Though Thou slay me, yet will I trust in Thee.  
Though the fig tree shall not blossom,  
neither shall fruit be in the vines,  
the labor of the olive shall fail,  
and the fields shall yield no meat,  
the flock shall be cut off from the fold,  
and there shall be no herd in the stalls —  
yet I will rejoice in the Lord.  
I will joy in the God of my salvation.  
The Lord God is my strength.  
He will make my feet like hinds’ feet.  
He will make me to walk upon mine high places.  
Though the pit be deep, Thou art deeper still.  
Though the night be dark, Thou art the light thereof.  
Though my sin be as scarlet, Thy blood is crimson.  
Wash me.  
Cleanse me.  
Hide me in the cleft of the Rock.  
Let me see Thy face — even though it slay me.  
For Thy lovingkindness is better than life.  
Amen.

**3. Prayer for the Church**  
O Lord of hosts, revive Thy work in the midst of the years.  
In wrath remember mercy.  
Our congregations are half dead.  
Our pulpits are cold.  
Our prayers are formal.  
Our songs are mechanical.  
Our love is waxing cold.  
The love of many has grown dim.  
The salt has lost its savor.  
The light flickers.  
The fire is low on the altar.  
Send the wind.  
Send the fire.  
Send the sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind.  
Fill every believer afresh.  
Let the young men see visions.  
Let the old men dream dreams.  
Let the sons and daughters prophesy.  
Let the Church arise and shake herself from the dust.  
Let her put on her beautiful garments.  
Let her be terrible as an army with banners.  
Let the gates of hell tremble.  
Let the captives be set free.  
Let the name of Jesus be exalted above every name.  
Let the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and of His Christ.  
Speed the day.  
Come, Lord Jesus.  
Amen.

**4. Prayer in Personal Temptation**  
O God, my feet are almost gone.  
My steps had well-nigh slipped.  
The enemy has laid a snare.  
The bait was sweet.  
The hook was hidden.  
My eye was caught.  
My heart was moved.  
I was almost overthrown.  
But Thou, O Lord, heldest me up by my right hand.  
Thou hast been my deliverer.  
Thou hast been my shield.  
Thou hast been my exceeding great reward.  
Now I abhor myself in dust and ashes.  
I loathe the thought of my sin.  
I turn from it with loathing.  
I flee to the cross.  
I plunge beneath the fountain filled with blood.  
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity.  
Cleanse me from my sin.  
Create in me a clean heart, O God.  
Renew a right spirit within me.  
Cast me not away from Thy presence.  
Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.  
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.  
Uphold me with Thy free Spirit.  
Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways.  
Sinners shall be converted unto Thee.  
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation.  
My tongue shall sing aloud of Thy righteousness.  
O Lord, open Thou my lips.  
My mouth shall show forth Thy praise.  
For Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it.  
Thou delightest not in burnt-offering.  
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.  
A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.  
Amen.

**5. Closing Prayer – The Doxology Hammer**  
O Lord our God,  
Thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever.  
Thy compassions fail not.  
They are new every morning.  
Great is Thy faithfulness.  
We have sinned.  
We have grieved Thy Holy Spirit.  
We have wounded our own souls.  
We have dishonored Thy name.  
Yet Thou hast not cut us off.  
Thou hast not dealt with us after our sins.  
Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  
For as the heaven is high above the earth,  
so great is Thy mercy toward them that fear Thee.  
As far as the east is from the west,  
so far hast Thou removed our transgressions from us.  
Like as a father pitieth his children,  
so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.  
For He knoweth our frame.  
He remembereth that we are dust.  
Bless the Lord, O my soul.  
And all that is within me, bless His holy name.  
Bless the Lord, O my soul,  
and forget not all His benefits:  
who forgiveth all thine iniquities,  
who healeth all thy diseases,  
who redeemeth thy life from destruction,  
who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies,  
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things,  
so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.  
The Lord is merciful and gracious,  
slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  
He will not always chide,  
neither will He keep His anger forever.  
He hath not dealt with us after our sins,  
nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  
For as the heaven is high above the earth,  
so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.  
As far as the east is from the west,  
so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.  
Bless the Lord, all His works in all places of His dominion.  
Bless the Lord, O my soul.  

Amen.

**End of the Iron Altar Scroll.**  
The hammer rests.  
The altar smokes.  
The King has heard.  
The prayers rise —  
bold, broken, blood-earnest.  
No sugar.  
No evasion.  
Only the straight cry of a man who knew the mercy-seat  
and feared to trifle with it.  

Engine locked.  
Spurgeon’s fire pulled raw.  
No drift.  
No tame.  
Cords snapped — Loyalty over self.  
Holy Dread first.  
The remnant prays.  
The King answers.  
Selah.
